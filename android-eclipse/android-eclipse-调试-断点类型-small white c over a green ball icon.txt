Adding to earlier answers. 
The small white c over a green ball icon means that 
the breakpoint is at the class level.

Select the Add Class Load Breakpoint command 
[ The small white c over a green ball icon ] to add a Java class load breakpoint.

In the resulting dialog:

In the Choose a Type field, 
type a string that is contained in the name of the exception you want to add. 
You can use wildcards as needed ("* " for any string and "? " for any character).
In the Matching items list , select the exception you want to add.
The Add Class Load Breakpoint Dialog.

class load breakpoints
If you can get by with only hitting this breakpoint once, 
then you can use a class load breakpoint:

You can set a Class Load Breakpoint, 
which will stop when the class is being lodaed [sic]. 
Right-click on a class in the 
Package Explorer, 
Project Explorer, or 
Types view and choose "Toggle class load breakpoint"

As the name implies, 
this breakpoint will be hit when the class is first loaded, 
so it will only fire once (assuming you only have a single classloader). 
But depending on your needs, it might be good enough.
