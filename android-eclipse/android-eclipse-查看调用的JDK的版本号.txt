Click on Add Library button, it brings you screen to point to JAVA location.

Select "Directory" button right beside JRE home and point to installed folder location.

Even though you want to just 1.5 compiler project, you can achieve it by changing compiler settings in eclipse instead of removing 1.6 JRE and add 1.5 JRE.

GOTO -->JAVA--Compiler---> and change compiler level to `1.5` instead of `1.6`
EDIT: As davidfmatheson suggested,

Just be careful, especially if you're setting this up for a team of people to work on. If anyone uses anything that is new or changed in 1.6, it will compile, but not run in an environment with JRE 1.5.
