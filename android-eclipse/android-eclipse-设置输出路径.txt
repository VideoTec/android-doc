First Create a new source folder call it something like res, 
you can use this folder to store your data files. 

Next open the Java Build Path section of the project properties (from the context menu of the project). 
Select the Source tab. 
In this tab you can control the output folders of each of the source folders. 
By default eclipse copies all the non-java files int the source folder to output directory during the build.
