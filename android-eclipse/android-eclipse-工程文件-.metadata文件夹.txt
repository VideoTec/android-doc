The .metadata folder is an area where Eclipse plug-ins can save any information they want to save. 
This will include things like 
your preference setting and 
the index the Java plug-in uses to find classes and methods quickly.

It also includes the .log file where Eclipse logs errors.

Exactly what is stored there depends on the plug-ins you have installed 
(one of my plug-ins has a database in the .metadata) 
so it is a good idea to back it up (along with the projects).
