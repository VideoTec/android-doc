开机后，打开ECLIPSE编译出现下面的错误。之前还是好的

Description	Resource	Path	Location	Type
The project was not built since its build path is incomplete. 
Cannot find the class file for java.lang.Object. Fix the build path then try building this project	OpenSLTest		Unknown	Java Problem

出错时，工程里没有 包含 android.jar
关闭重启 eclipse 就好了，真不知道是什么原因啊

2015.4.9 又发现这个问题最后重启，就可以了，猜测可能的原因：第一次启动时，eclipse没有加载 android sdk

下面是网上找到的一段
It seems that you lack JDK (java.lang.Object comes from there )

The problem is that you used the same Android API on different PC. 
Eclipse is lost with path names that are differents but with same API.

To solve it, first re-select Android API version 
(set to another one and valid, then restore the on you want and validate it -> it will force Eclipse to reload API). 
Then go into project->properties-> java build path. 
Then remove "Unable to get system library for the project" then "Add library" and select "Android Classpath container".
