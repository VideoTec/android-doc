Because Android is designed for mobile devices, you should always be careful about how much random-access memory (RAM) your app uses. Although Dalvik and ART perform routine garbage collection (GC), this doesn’t mean you can ignore when and where your app allocates and releases memory. In order to provide a stable user experience that allows the system to quickly switch between apps, it is important that your app does not needlessly consume memory when the user is not interacting with it.
