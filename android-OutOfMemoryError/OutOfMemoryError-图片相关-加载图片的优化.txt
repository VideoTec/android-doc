1）Load a Scaled Down Version into Memory

To tell the decoder to subsample the image, loading a smaller version into memory, set inSampleSize to true in your BitmapFactory.Options object. For example, an image with resolution 2048x1536 that is decoded with an inSampleSize of 4 produces a bitmap of approximately 512x384. Loading this into memory uses 0.75MB rather than 12MB for the full image (assuming a bitmap configuration of ARGB_8888)

2）Read Bitmap Dimensions and Type
dimension[英][daɪˈmenʃn] [美][dɪˈmɛnʃən, daɪ-]
n.尺寸；[复]面积，范围；[物]量纲；[数]次元，度，维

To avoid java.lang.OutOfMemory exceptions, 
check the dimensions of a bitmap before decoding it, 
unless you absolutely trust the source to 
provide you with predictably sized image data 
that comfortably fits within the available memory

Setting the inJustDecodeBounds property to true 
while decoding avoids memory allocation, 
returning null for the bitmap object 
but setting outWidth, outHeight and outMimeType
