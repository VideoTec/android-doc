Avoid non-static inner classes in an activity 
if you don't control their life cycle, 
use a static inner class and make a weak reference to the activity inside. 

The solution to this issue is to use 
a static inner class with a WeakReference to the outer class, 
as done in ViewRoot and its W inner class for instance

非静态内部类，隐含的外部类引用
The example above showed the case of a static reference 
but inner classes and their implicit reference to the outer class can be equally dangerous.
