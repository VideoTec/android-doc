One of the user visible changes in 0.11 is that 
we've deprecated the 
packageName and 
packageNameSuffix settings, and 
have renamed them to 
applicationId and 
applicationIdSuffix. 
The purpose of this is to make it clear that 
this application id is decoupled from package declarations in your manifest, 
and in particular, the R class and the BuildConfig class, 
and all the implementation classes inside your app, 
can be renamed and refactored（重构） freely; 
you just need to keep applicationId the same. 
If you open your build.gradle file, 
lint is highlighting these deprecated calls and offering quickfixes to update them
