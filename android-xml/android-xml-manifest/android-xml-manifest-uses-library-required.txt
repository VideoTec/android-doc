android:required

Boolean value that indicates 
whether the application requires the library specified by android:name:

"true": 
The application does not function without this library. 
The system will not allow the application on a device 
that does not have the library.

"false": 
The application can use the library if present, 
but is designed to function without it if necessary. 
The system will allow the application to be installed, 
even if the library is not present. 
If you use "false", 
you are responsible for checking at runtime that the library is available.
To check for a library, 
you can use reflection to determine if a particular class is available.

The default is "true".
