Merge Conflict Rules

Merge conflicts occur 
when merged manifests contain the same manifest element 
but with a different attribute value 
that does not resolve based on the default merge conflict rules. 
Conflict markers and selectors can also define custom merge rules, 
such as allowing an imported library to have a minSdkVersion 
higher than the version defined in the other higher priority manifests.

The manifest merge priority determines 
which manifest settings are retained in merge conflicts, 
with the settings in higher priority manifest overwriting those in lower priority manifests. 
The following list details 
which manifest settings are are the highest priority during the merge process:

1）Highest priority: buildType manifest settings

2）Higher priority: productFlavor manifest settings
3）Medium priority: Manifests in the src/main/ directory of an app project
4）Low priority: Dependency and library manifest settings

Manifest merge conflicts are resolved at the XML node and attribute levels 
based on the following merge rules.

一般规则之外的，例外情况：
Exceptions to the manifest merge rules:

1）The 
uses-feature android:required; and 
uses-library android:required elements default to true and 
use an OR merge so that any required feature or library is included in the generated APK.

2）If not declared, the <uses-sdk> elements, minSdkVersion and targetSdkVersion, default to a value of 1. When merge conflicts occur, the value in the higher priority manifest version is used.
3）Importing a library with a minSdkVersion value higher than the app's src/main/ manifest manifest generates an error unless the overrideLibrary conflict marker is used.
