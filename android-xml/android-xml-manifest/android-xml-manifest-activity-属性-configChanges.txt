android:configChanges

Lists configuration changes that the activity will handle itself. 
When a configuration change occurs at runtime, 
the activity is shut down and restarted by default, 
but declaring a configuration with this attribute 
will prevent the activity from being restarted. 

Instead, the activity remains running and its onConfigurationChanged() method is called.

Note: 
Using this attribute should be avoided and used only as a last resort. 
Please read Handling Runtime Changes for more information 
about how to properly handle a restart due to a configuration change.

Any or all of the following strings are valid values for this attribute. 
Multiple values are separated by '|' â€” for example, "locale|navigation|orientation".
