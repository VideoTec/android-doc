android:taskAffinity

The task that the activity has an affinity for. 
Activities with the same affinity conceptually belong to the same task 
(to the same "application" from the user's perspective). 
The affinity of a task is determined by the affinity of its root activity.
The affinity determines two things — 
the task that the activity is re-parented to (see the allowTaskReparenting attribute) and 
the task that will house the activity 
when it is launched with the FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK flag.

By default, all activities in an application have the same affinity. 
You can set this attribute to group them differently, 
and even place activities defined in different applications within the same task. 
To specify that the activity does not have an affinity for any task, 
set it to an empty string.

If this attribute is not set, 
the activity inherits the affinity set for the application 
(see the <application> element's taskAffinity attribute). 
The name of the default affinity for an application is the package name set by the <manifest> element.
