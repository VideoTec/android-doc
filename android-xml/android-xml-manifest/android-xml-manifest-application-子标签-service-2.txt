Declares a service (a Service subclass) as one of the application's components. Unlike activities, services lack a visual user interface. They're used to implement long-running background operations or a rich communications API that can be called by other applications.
All services must be represented by <service> elements in the manifest file. Any that are not declared there will not be seen by the system and will never be run.
