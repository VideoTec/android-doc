android:label

A user-readable label for the application as a whole, and a default label for each of the application's components. 

See the individual label attributes for 
<activity>, <activity-alias>, <service>, <receiver>, and <provider> elements.

The label should be set as a reference to a string resource, 
so that it can be localized like other strings in the user interface. 
However, as a convenience while you're developing the application, 
it can also be set as a raw string.
