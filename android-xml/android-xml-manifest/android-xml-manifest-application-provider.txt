DESCRIPTION:

Declares a content provider component. A content provider is a subclass of ContentProvider that supplies structured access to data managed by the application. All content providers in your application must be defined in a <provider> element in the manifest file; otherwise, the system is unaware of them and doesn't run them.
You only declare content providers that are part of your application. Content providers in other applications that you use in your application should not be declared.

The Android system stores references to content providers according to an authority string, part of the provider's content URI. For example, suppose you want to access a content provider that stores information about health care professionals. To do this, you call the method ContentResolver.query(), which among other arguments takes a URI that identifies the provider:

content://com.example.project.healthcareprovider/nurses/rn
The content: scheme identifies the URI as a content URI pointing to an Android content provider. The authority com.example.project.healthcareprovider identifies the provider itself; the Android system looks up the authority in its list of known providers and their authorities. The substring nurses/rn is a path, which the content provider can use to identify subsets of the provider data.

Notice that when you define your provider in the <provider> element, you don't include the scheme or the path in the android:name argument, only the authority.

For information on using and developing content providers, see the API Guide, Content Providers.
