With Android Studio and Gradle-based builds, 
each app can contain manifest files in multiple locations, 
such as the src/main/ folder for the 
1）productFlavor, 
2）libraries, 
3）Android ARchive (AAR) bundles of Android Library projects, and 
4）dependencies. 
During the build process, 
manifest merging combines the settings from the various AndroidManifest.xml files 
included in your app into a single, 
generated APK manifest file for app packaging and distribution. 
Manifest settings are merged based on the manifest priority, 
determined by the manifest's file location. 
Building your app merges the manifest elements, attributes, and sub-elements 
from these manifests for the specified build variant.
