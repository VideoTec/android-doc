Provide at least an xxxhdpi app icon 
because devices can display large app icons on the launcher. 
It’s best practice to place your app icons in mipmap- folders 
(not the drawable- folders) 
because they are used at resolutions different from the device’s current density.
 
For example, 
an xxxhdpi app icon can be used on the launcher for an xxhdpi device.
