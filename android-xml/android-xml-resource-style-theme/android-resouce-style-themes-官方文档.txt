A style is a collection of properties 
that specify the look and format for a View or window. 
A style can specify properties 
such as height, padding, font color, font size, background color, and much more. 
A style is defined in an XML resource 
that is separate from the XML that specifies the layout.

类似于 网页中的 CSS 技术：
Styles in Android share a similar philosophy 
to cascading stylesheets in web design—they 
allow you to separate the design from the content.

样式（theme）一般应用到整个 ACT 或者 APP 中：
A theme is a style applied to an entire Activity or application, 
rather than an individual View (as in the example above). 
When a style is applied as a theme, 
every View in the Activity or application will apply each style property that it supports. 
For example, 
you can apply the same CodeFont style as a theme for an Activity 
and then all text inside that Activity will have green monospace font.
