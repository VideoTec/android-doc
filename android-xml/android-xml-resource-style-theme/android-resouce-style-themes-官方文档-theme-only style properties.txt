Some style properties, 
however, are not supported by any View element and can only be applied as a theme. 
These style properties apply to the entire window and not to any type of View. 

For example, 
style properties for a theme can 
hide the application title, 
hide the status bar, or 
change the window's background. 

These kind of style properties do not belong to any View object. 
To discover these theme-only style properties, 
look at the R.attr reference for attributes that begin with window.

For instance, windowNoTitle and windowBackground are style properties 
that are effective only 
when the style is applied as a theme to an Activity or application. 
See the next section for information about applying a style as a theme.
