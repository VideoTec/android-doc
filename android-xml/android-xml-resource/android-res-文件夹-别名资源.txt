什么情况合适使用别名资源
-----------------------------------------------
When you have a resource that you'd like to use for more than one device configuration 
(but do not want to provide as a default resource), 
you do not need to put the same resource in more than one alternative resource directory. 

Instead, you can (in some cases) create an alternative resource 
that acts as an alias for a resource saved in your default resource directory.

-----------------------------------------------
能够定义别名 的资源类型
-----------------------------------------------
Not all resources offer a mechanism by which you can create an alias to another resource. In particular, animation, menu, raw, and other unspecified resources in the xml/ directory do not offer this feature.

-----------------------------------------------
怎么定义 别名资源
-----------------------------------------------
For example, imagine you have an application icon, icon.png, and need unique version of it for different locales. 
However, two locales, English-Canadian and French-Canadian, need to use the same version. 

You might assume that you need to 
copy the same image into the resource directory for both English-Canadian and French-Canadian, but it's not true. 

Instead, you can 
save the image that's used for both as icon_ca.png (any name other than icon.png) and 
put it in the default res/drawable/ directory. 
Then create an icon.xml file in res/drawable-en-rCA/ and res/drawable-fr-rCA/ 
that refers to the icon_ca.png resource using the <bitmap> element. 

This allows you to store just 
one version of the PNG file and 
two small XML files that point to it. (An example XML file is shown below.)

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<bitmap xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    android:src="@drawable/icon_ca" />

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<merge>
    <include layout="@layout/main_ltr"/>
</merge>

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<resources>
    <string name="hello">Hello</string>
    <string name="hi">@string/hello</string>
</resources>
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<resources>
    <color name="yellow">#f00</color>
    <color name="highlight">@color/red</color>
</resources>
