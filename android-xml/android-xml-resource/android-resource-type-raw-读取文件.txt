From the Android documentation, the raw/ directory is used for:

Arbitrary files to save in their raw form. 
To open these resources with a raw InputStream, 
call Resources.openRawResource() with the resource ID, which is R.raw.filename.

However, if you need access to original file names and file hierarchy, 
you might consider saving some resources in the assets/ directory (instead of res/raw/). 
Files in assets/ are not given a resource ID, 
so you can read them only using AssetManager.

In one line, 
the files in the raw/ directory are not compiled by the platform, 
are assigned a resource ID and cannot be grouped into sub-folders whereas 
if you want the otherwise use the assets/ directory.
