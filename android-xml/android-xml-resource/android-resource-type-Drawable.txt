A drawable resource is a general concept for a graphic that 
can be drawn to the screen and which you 
can retrieve with APIs such as getDrawable(int) or 
apply to another XML resource with attributes such as android:drawable and android:icon. 
例如：
android:background="@drawable/video_beautify_btn_save_selector"
