The Android platform provides a large collection of styles and themes that you can use in your applications. 
You can find a reference of all available styles in the R.style class. 
To use the styles listed here, replace all underscores in the style name with a period. 
For example, you can apply the Theme_NoTitleBar theme with "@android:style/Theme.NoTitleBar".

The R.style reference, however, is not well documented and does not thoroughly describe the styles, 
so viewing the actual source code for these styles and themes 
will give you a better understanding of what style properties each one provides. 
For a better reference to the Android styles and themes, see the following source code:

Android Styles (styles.xml)
Android Themes (themes.xml)

These files will help you learn through example. 
For instance, in the Android themes source code, you'll find a declaration for <style name="Theme.Dialog">. 
In this definition, you'll see all of the properties that are used to style dialogs 
that are used by the Android framework.

For more information about the syntax for styles and themes in XML, see the Style Resource document.

For a reference of available style attributes 
that you can use to define a style or theme (e.g., "windowBackground" or "textAppearance"), 
see R.attr or the respective View class for which you are creating a style.
