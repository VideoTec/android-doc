概述：

XML files that contain simple values, such as strings, integers, and colors.

Whereas XML resource files in other res/ subdirectories define a single resource based on the XML filename, 
files in the values/ directory describe multiple resources. 

For a file in this directory, each child of the <resources> element defines a single resource. 
For example, 
a <string> element creates an R.string resource and 
a <color> element creates an R.color resource.

Because each resource is defined with its own XML element, 
you can name the file whatever you want and place different resource types in one file. 

However, for clarity, you might want to place unique resource types in different files. 
For example, here are some filename conventions for resources you can create in this directory:

其中 values 目录下有什么文件：
arrays.xml for resource arrays (typed arrays).
colors.xml for color values
dimens.xml for dimension values.
strings.xml for string values.
styles.xml for styles.
