Define Custom Attributes
To add a built-in View to your user interface, you specify it in an XML element and control its appearance and behavior with element attributes. Well-written custom views can also be added and styled via XML. To enable this behavior in your custom view, you must:

1）Define custom attributes for your view in a <declare-styleable> resource element
2）Specify values for the attributes in your XML layout
3）Retrieve attribute values at runtime
4）Apply the retrieved attribute values to your view
