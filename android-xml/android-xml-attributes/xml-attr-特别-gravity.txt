android:gravity
Specifies how to align the text by the view's x- and/or y-axis 
when the text is smaller than the view.
Must be one or more (separated by '|') of the following constant values.

http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/RelativeLayout.html#attr_android:gravity

android:gravity
Specifies how an object should position its content, on both the X and Y axes, within its own bounds.

Describes how the child views are positioned. Defaults to Gravity.START | Gravity.TOP

Note that since RelativeLayout considers the positioning of each child relative to one another to be significant, setting gravity will affect the positioning of all children as a single unit within the parent. This happens after children have been relatively positioned.

top	0x30	Push object to the top of its container, not changing its size.
bottom	0x50	Push object to the bottom of its container, not changing its size.
left	0x03	Push object to the left of its container, not changing its size.
right	0x05	Push object to the right of its container, not changing its size.
center_vertical	0x10	Place object in the vertical center of its container, not changing its size.
fill_vertical	0x70	Grow the vertical size of the object if needed so it completely fills its container.
center_horizontal	0x01	Place object in the horizontal center of its container, not changing its size.
fill_horizontal	0x07	Grow the horizontal size of the object if needed so it completely fills its container.
center	0x11	Place the object in the center of its container in both the vertical and horizontal axis, not changing its size.
fill	0x77	Grow the horizontal and vertical size of the object if needed so it completely fills its container.
clip_vertical	0x80	Additional option that can be set to have the top and/or bottom edges of the child clipped to its container's bounds. The clip will be based on the vertical gravity: a top gravity will clip the bottom edge, a bottom gravity will clip the top edge, and neither will clip both edges.
clip_horizontal	0x08	Additional option that can be set to have the left and/or right edges of the child clipped to its container's bounds. The clip will be based on the horizontal gravity: a left gravity will clip the right edge, a right gravity will clip the left edge, and neither will clip both edges.
start	0x00800003	Push object to the beginning of its container, not changing its size.
end	0x00800005	Push object to the end of its container, not changing its size.
