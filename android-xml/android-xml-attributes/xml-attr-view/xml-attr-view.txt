The classes which have XML attributes, list them XML attributes in their own documentation.

Every View and ViewGroup object supports their own variety of XML attributes. 

Some attributes are specific to a View object (for example, TextView supports the textSize attribute), 
but these attributes are also inherited by any View objects that may extend this class. 

Some are common to all View objects, because they are inherited from the root View class (like the id attribute).

And, other attributes are considered "layout parameters," which are attributes 
that describe certain layout orientations of the View object, 
as defined by that object's parent ViewGroup object.
