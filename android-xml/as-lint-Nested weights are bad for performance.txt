Nested weights are bad for performance because:

Layout weights require a widget to be measured twice. 
When a LinearLayout with non-zero weights is nested inside another LinearLayout with non-zero weights, 
then the number of measurements increase exponentially.

It's always better to use RelativeLayouts 
and adjust your view according to 
the places of other views without using specific dpi values.
