The getParent method returns a ViewParent, not a View. 
You need to cast the first call to getParent() also:

RelativeLayout r = (RelativeLayout) ((ViewGroup) this.getParent()).getParent();

ViewParent is just an interface that any View that can have children implements. 
Most of the times the class you get back will be an instance of a ViewGroup, 
like LinearLayout or RelativeLayout. 
I'm not exactly sure what you mean by "name" 
but if you want to get the class name you can do so like always: 
view.getParent().getClass().getName()
