android:layout_gravity


包含这个属性的 布局参数类 有

第一组
android.widget.LinearLayout.LayoutParams
ActionMenuView.LayoutParams, RadioGroup.LayoutParams, TableLayout.LayoutParams, TableRow.LayoutParams

第二组
android.widget.FrameLayout.LayoutParams
android.support.v17.leanback.widget.BaseCardView.LayoutParams

第三组，和 android.widget.RelativeLayout.LayoutParams 的关系
android.widget.RelativeLayout.LayoutParams 没有这个属性，

但是 RelativeLayout 的属性：
android:gravity	setGravity(int)	
Specifies how an object should position its content, on both the X and Y axes, within its own bounds. 
android:ignoreGravity	setIgnoreGravity(int)	
Indicates what view should not be affected by gravity. 

Standard gravity constant that a child supplies to its parent. 
Defines how the child view should be positioned, on both the X and Y axes, within its enclosing layout.

Must be one or more (separated by '|') of the following constant values.

Constant  Value  Description
top     0x30  Push object to the top of its container, not changing its size.
bottom  0x50  Push object to the bottom of its container, not changing its size.
left    0x03  Push object to the left of its container, not changing its size.
right   0x05  Push object to the right of its container, not changing its size.

center              0x11  
Place the object in the center of its container in both the vertical and horizontal axis, not changing its size.

center_vertical     0x10  
Place object in the vertical center of its container, not changing its size.

center_horizontal   0x01  
Place object in the horizontal center of its container, not changing its size.

start               0x00800003  
Push object to the beginning of its container, not changing its size.

fill_vertical       0x70  
Grow the vertical size of the object if needed so it completely fills its container.

fill_horizontal     0x07  
Grow the horizontal size of the object if needed so it completely fills its container.

fill                0x77  
Grow the horizontal and vertical size of the object if needed so it completely fills its container.

end                 0x00800005  
Push object to the end of its container, not changing its size.

clip_vertical       0x80  
Additional option that can be set to have the top and/or bottom edges of the child clipped to its container's bounds. The clip will be based on the vertical gravity: a top gravity will clip the bottom edge, a bottom gravity will clip the top edge, and neither will clip both edges.

clip_horizontal     0x08  
Additional option that can be set to have the left and/or right edges of the child clipped to its container's bounds. The clip will be based on the horizontal gravity: a left gravity will clip the right edge, a right gravity will clip the left edge, and neither will clip both edges.
