android:layoutDirection

Defines the direction of layout drawing. 
This typically is associated with writing direction of the language script used. 

The possible values are 
1）"ltr" for Left-to-Right, 
2）"rtl" for Right-to-Left, 
3）"locale" and "inherit" from parent view. 

If there is nothing to inherit, "locale" is used. 
"locale" falls back to "en-US". 
"ltr" is the direction used in "en-US". 
The default for this attribute is "inherit".

Must be one of the following constant values.

Constant    Value    Description
ltr             0    Left-to-Right
rtl             1    Right-to-Left
inherit         2    Inherit from parent
locale          3    Locale
This corresponds to the global attribute resource symbol layoutDirection.
