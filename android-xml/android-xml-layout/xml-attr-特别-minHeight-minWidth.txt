android:minHeight

Defines the minimum height of the view. It is not guaranteed the view will be able to achieve this minimum height (for example, if its parent layout constrains it with less available height).

Must be a dimension value, which is a floating point number appended with a unit such as "14.5sp". Available units are: px (pixels), dp (density-independent pixels), sp (scaled pixels based on preferred font size), in (inches), mm (millimeters).

This may also be a reference to a resource (in the form "@[package:]type:name") or theme attribute (in the form "?[package:][type:]name") containing a value of this type.

This corresponds to the global attribute resource symbol minHeight.
