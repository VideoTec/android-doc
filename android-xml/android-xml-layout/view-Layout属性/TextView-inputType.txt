android:inputType

The type of data being placed in a text field, used to help an input method decide how to let the user enter text. The constants here correspond to those defined by InputType. Generally you can select a single value, though some can be combined together as indicated. Setting this attribute to anything besides none also implies that the text is editable.

Must be one or more (separated by '|') of the following constant values.

1）Specify the Keyboard Type
You should always declare the input method for your text fields 
by adding the android:inputType attribute to the <EditText> element.

2）Enable Spelling Suggestions and Other Behaviors
The android:inputType attribute allows you to specify various behaviors for the input method. Most importantly, if your text field is intended for basic text input (such as for a text message), you should enable auto spelling correction with the "textAutoCorrect" value.
