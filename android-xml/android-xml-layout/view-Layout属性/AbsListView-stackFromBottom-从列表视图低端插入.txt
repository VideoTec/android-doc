android:stackFromBottom

Used by ListView and GridView to stack their content from the bottom.

Must be a boolean value, either "true" or "false".

This may also be a reference to a resource (in the form "@[package:]type:name") or theme attribute (in the form "?[package:][type:]name") containing a value of this type.

This corresponds to the global attribute resource symbol stackFromBottom.
