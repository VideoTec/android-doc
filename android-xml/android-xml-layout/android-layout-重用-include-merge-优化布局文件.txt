The <merge /> tag is extremely useful and can do wonders in your code. 
However, it suffers from a couple of limitation:

1）<merge /> can only be used as the root tag of an XML layout
2）When inflating a layout starting with a <merge />, 
you must specify a parent ViewGroup and 
you must set attachToRoot to true (see the documentation of the inflate() method)
