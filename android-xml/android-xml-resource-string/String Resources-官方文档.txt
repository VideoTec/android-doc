String Resources
A string resource provides text strings for your application with optional text styling and formatting. 
There are three types of resources that can provide your application with strings:

String
XML resource that provides a single string.

String Array
XML resource that provides an array of strings.

Quantity Strings (Plurals)
XML resource that carries different strings for pluralization.

All strings are capable of applying some styling markup and formatting arguments. 
For information about styling and formatting strings, 
see the section about Formatting and Styling.
