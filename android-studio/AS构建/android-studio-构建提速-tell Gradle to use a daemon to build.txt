The Gradle daemon is a great way to speed up your builds, 
which is extremely useful when you have to build your application repeatedly. 
The basic idea is to fork a “daemon” process [1] 
which can be reused on subsequent builds, rather than launching a new JVM on every build.

The good news is that Android Studio always keeps a Gradle daemon around for you. 
However, if you build from the command line, 
you need to tell gradle that you want to use the Gradle daemon. 
You can use command line arguments [2] to interact with Gradle daemon, 
but the easiest way is to add a daemon property to your gradle.properties file:

org.gradle.daemon=true
