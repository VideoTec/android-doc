It is a two step process. The unaligned apk is just an intermediate product.

the unaligned apk is generated
the unaligned gets aligned and produces the aligned apk

Right. Some IDEs produce it as end product for the debug build to speed up the build process.
it's basically the same content as the aligned zip file, only that file boundaries are not aligned to 4b blocks
