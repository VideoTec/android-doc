停止启动时的，自动构建（initial build）

I'd like to request what seems to be a missing feature on Android Studio: 
the ability to disable/enable initial build upon opening a project. 
For a large project, this can add quite a bit of time to the startup process. Thanks!

Instead of a full compile on startup, we will be doing just code generation (e.g. R.java.) 
This is to ensure that Studio has all the source code it needs for editing. 
This step should be fast, since there is no dexing
