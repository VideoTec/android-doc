The command-line options available for the gradle command are listed below:
--offline
Specifies that the build should operate without accessing network resources. 
See Section 52.9.2, “Command line options to override caching”.

52.9.2.1. Offline

The --offline command line switch tells Gradle to always use dependency modules from the cache, 
regardless if they are due to be checked again. 
When running with offline, Gradle will never attempt to access the network to perform dependency resolution. 
If required modules are not present in the dependency cache, build execution will fail.
