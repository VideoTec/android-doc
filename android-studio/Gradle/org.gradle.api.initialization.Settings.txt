public interface Settings
extends PluginAware

Declares the configuration required to 
instantiate and configure the hierarchy of Project instances 
which are to participate in a build.

There is a one-to-one correspondence between 
1）a Settings instance and 
2）a "settings.gradle" settings file. 

Before Gradle assembles the projects for a build, it 
1）creates a Settings instance and
2）executes the settings file against it.
