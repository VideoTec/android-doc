You can't debug Gradle files. 
We may someday implement this, as it would obviously be a great thing, 
but it's a long ways off. 

We're in the process of adding more intelligence about syntax highlighting and analysis of build files. Well, actually, JetBrains is adding it to IntelliJ and we're picking it up. 

This will get better over the coming weeks and months.
