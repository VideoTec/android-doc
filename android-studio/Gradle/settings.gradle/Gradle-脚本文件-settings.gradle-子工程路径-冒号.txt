59.5. Project and task paths

工程的路径：
A project path has the following pattern: 
It starts with an optional colon, which denotes the root project. 
The root project is the only project in a path that is not specified by its name. 
The rest of a project path is a colon-separated sequence of project names, 
where the next project is a subproject of the previous project.

任务的路径：
The path of a task is simply its project path plus the task name, 
like “:bluewhale:hello”. 
Within a project you can address a task of the same project just by its name. 
This is interpreted as a relative path.
