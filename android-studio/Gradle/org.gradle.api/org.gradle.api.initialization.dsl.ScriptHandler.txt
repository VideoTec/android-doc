Interface ScriptHandler

public interface ScriptHandler

A ScriptHandler allows you to 
manage the compilation and 
execution of a build script. 

You can declare the classpath used to compile and execute a build script. 
This classpath is also used to load the plugins which the build script uses.

You can obtain a ScriptHandler instance 
using Project.getBuildscript() or Script.getBuildscript().

To declare the script classpath, 
you use the DependencyHandler provided by getDependencies() 
to attach dependencies to the "classpath" configuration. 

These dependencies are resolved just prior to script compilation, 
and assembled into the classpath for the script.

For most external dependencies 
you will also need to declare one or more repositories 
where the dependencies can be found, 
using the RepositoryHandler provided by getRepositories().
