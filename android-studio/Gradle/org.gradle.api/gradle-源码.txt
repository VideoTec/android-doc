Gradle is a build tool 
with a focus on build automation and support for multi-language development. 

If you are 
1）building, 
2）testing, 
3）publishing, and 
4）deploying software on any platform, 
Gradle offers a flexible model that can 
support the entire development lifecycle 
from compiling and packaging code to publishing web sites. 

Gradle has been designed to 
support build automation across multiple languages and platforms 
including Java, Scala, Android, C/C++, and Groovy, 
and is closely integrated with development tools and 
continuous integration servers including 
1）Eclipse, 
2）IntelliJ, and 
3）Jenkins.
