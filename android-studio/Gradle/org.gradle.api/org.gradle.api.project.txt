Interface Project

public interface Project
extends Comparable<Project>, ExtensionAware, PluginAware

This interface is the main API you use to interact with Gradle from your build file. 
From a Project, 
you have programmatic access to all of Gradle's features.

Lifecycle

There is a one-to-one relationship between 

a Project and 
a "build.gradle" file. 

During build initialisation, 
Gradle assembles a Project object for each project 
which is to participate in the build, as follows:

1）Create a Settings instance for the build.
2）Evaluate the "settings.gradle" script, if present, against the Settings object to configure it.
3）Use the configured Settings object to create the hierarchy of Project instances.
4）Finally, evaluate each Project by executing its "build.gradle" file, 
if present, against the project. 
The projects are evaluated in breadth-wise order, 
such that a project is evaluated before its child projects. 
This order can be overridden 
by calling evaluationDependsOnChildren() or 
by adding an explicit evaluation dependency using evaluationDependsOn(String).
