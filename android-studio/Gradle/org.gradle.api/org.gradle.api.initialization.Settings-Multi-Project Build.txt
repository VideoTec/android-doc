Assembling a Multi-Project Build

One of the purposes of the Settings object is 
to allow you to declare the projects 
which are to be included in the build. 

You add projects to the build using the include(String[]) method. 

There is always a root project included in a build. 
It is added automatically when the Settings object is created. 
The root project's name 
defaults to the name of the directory containing the settings file. 
The root project's project directory 
defaults to the directory containing the settings file.

When a project is included in the build, a ProjectDescriptor is created. 
You can use this descriptor 
to change the default values for several properties of the project.
