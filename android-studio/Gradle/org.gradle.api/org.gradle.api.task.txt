public interface Task
extends Comparable<Task>, ExtensionAware

A Task represents a single atomic piece of work for a build, 
such as compiling classes or generating javadoc.

Each task belongs to a Project. 
You can use the various methods on TaskContainer to create and lookup task instances. 
For example, 
TaskContainer.create(String) 
creates an empty task with the given name. 
You can also use the task keyword in your build file:

 task myTask
 task myTask { configure closure }
 task myType << { task action }
 task myTask(type: SomeType)
 task myTask(type: SomeType) { configure closure }
 
Each task has a name, 
which can be used to refer to the task within its owning project, 
and a fully qualified path, which is unique across all tasks in all projects. 
The path is the concatenation of the owning project's path and the task's name. 
Path elements are separated using the ":" character.
