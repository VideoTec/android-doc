public interface FileCollection
extends Iterable<File>, AntBuilderAware, Buildable

A FileCollection represents a collection of files 
which you can query in certain ways. 

A file collection is often used to define a classpath, 
or to add files to a container.

You can obtain a FileCollection instance using 
Project.files(java.lang.Object...).
