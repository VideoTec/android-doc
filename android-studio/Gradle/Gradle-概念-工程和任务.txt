A project is essentially a collection of Task objects. 
Each task performs some basic piece of work, 

such as 
1）compiling classes, or 
2）running unit tests, or 
3）zipping up a WAR file. 

You add tasks to a project using one of the create() methods on TaskContainer, 
such as TaskContainer.create(String). 

You can locate existing tasks using one of the lookup methods on TaskContainer, 
such as TaskCollection.getByName(String).
