If you have some sources that you don't want to be compiled, you have to declare a filter for the sources, not for the class files that are put in the Jar. Something like:

sourceSets {
    main {
        java {
            include 'com/ourcompany/somepackage/activityadapter/**'
            include 'com/ourcompany/someotherpackage/**'
            exclude 'com/ourcompany/someotherpackage/polling/**'
        }
    }
}
