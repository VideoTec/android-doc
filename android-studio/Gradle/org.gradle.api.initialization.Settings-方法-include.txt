void include(String[] projectPaths)

Adds the given projects to the build. 
Each path in the supplied list is treated as the path of a project to add to the build. 

Note that these path are not file paths, 
but instead specify the location of the new project in the project hierarchy. 

As such, 
the supplied paths must use the ':' character as separator.

The last element of the supplied path is used as the project name. 
The supplied path is converted to a project directory 
relative to the root project directory.

As an example, 
the path a:b adds a project with path :a:b, 
1）name b and 
2）project directory $rootDir/a/b.

Parameters:
projectPaths - the projects to add.
