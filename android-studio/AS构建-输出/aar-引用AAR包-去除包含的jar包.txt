apply plugin: 'com.android.library' 
库工程中的 libs 目录下的 jar 文件，会自动输出到 aar 文件里。

怎么样才去除包含的 jar 包？

So according to these guys: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/adt-dev/g1AiJM7PeVs 
its not actually possible for me to exclude the snmp4j from within the aar file. 
It seems that the library needs to be rebuilt to not include snmp4j
