Whatever you do in IntelliJ IDEA, you do that in the context of a project. A project is an organizational unit that represents a complete software solution. It serves as a basis for coding assistance, bulk refactoring, coding style consistency, etc.

Your finished product may be decomposed into a series of discrete, isolated modules, but it's a project definition that brings them together and ties them into a greater whole.

Projects don't themselves contain development artifacts such as source code, build scripts, or documentation. They are the highest level of organization in the IDE, and they define project-wide settings as well as collections of what IntelliJ IDEA refers to as modules and libraries.
