Why doesn't Buck support Windows?

A: 
There are a number of engineering tasks 
that need to be addressed before Buck will run on Windows.

Buck uses symlinks under the hood in many places. 
We need to map that concept to the Windows equivalent throughout the codebase.

Buck hardcodes the use of OS X/Linux file and path separators all over the place. 
This may be a poor software design choice, 
but it makes the code more readable in many circumstances, 
particularly in unit tests.

Documentation becomes more work to maintain. 
For example, a nifty trick from the OS X/Linux command line, such as:

buck targets --type java_test | xargs buck test

does not work on Windows, 
so that must be documented separately.

The ./bin/buck script is written in Bash, so to support Windows, 
the equivalent would have to be maintained as a Windows Batch Script. 
Keeping both scripts in sync would be non-trivial. 

Alternatively, 
the run script could be written in a platform-independent language, such as Ruby, 
but that would require users to install an additional tool.

It increases the surface area of what needs to be tested.
Despite all of the work it will require, 
we do hope to support Windows in the future.
