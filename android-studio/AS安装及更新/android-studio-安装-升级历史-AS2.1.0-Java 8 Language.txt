The primary changes in this update provide 
support for development with the Android N Preview

The Android N platform adds support for Java 8 language features, 
which require a new experimental compiler called Jack. 
The latest version of Jack is currently supported only in Android Studio 2.1. 
So if you want to use Java 8 language features, 
you need to use Android Studio 2.1 to build your app.

Instant Run is disabled when you enable the Jack compiler 
because they currently are not compatible.

Although Android Studio 2.1 is now stable, 
the Jack compiler is still experimental and 
you must enable it with the jackOptions property in your build.gradle file.

Other than the changes to support the N Preview, 
Android Studio 2.1 includes minor bug fixes and the following enhancements:

The Java-aware C++ debugger is now enabled by default 
when you're using an N device or emulator and 
select Native debugger mode (in the Debugger tab for your run/debug configuration).

For other build enhancements, 
including incremental Java compilation and dexing-in-process, 
update your Android Plugin for Gradle to version 2.1.0.
