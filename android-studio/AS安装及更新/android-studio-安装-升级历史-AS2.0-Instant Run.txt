Instant Run:

Android Studio now deploys clean builds faster than ever before. 
Additionally, pushing incremental code changes 
to the emulator or a physical device is now almost instantaneous. 
Review your updates without redeploying a new debug build or, 
in many cases, without restarting the app.

Instant Run supports pushing the following changes to a running app:

1）Changes to the implementation of an existing instance method or static method
2）Changes to an existing app resource
3）Changes to structural code, such as a method signature or a static field 
(requires a target device running API level 21 or higher).

Note: 
Instant Run is supported only when you deploy the debug build variant, 
use Android Plugin for Gradle version 2.0.0 or higher, 
and configure your app's module-level build.gradle file for minSdkVersion 15 or higher. 
For the best performance, 
configure your app for minSdkVersion 21 or higher.
