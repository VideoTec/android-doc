Parallel Project Execution. [3] 
Parallel execution can make a significant difference 
if you are building a very complex project with many sub-projects 
(for example, Android library projects). 

Gradle has an in-development Parallel Mode 
which enables parallel execution of sub-projects that are decoupled. 

“Decoupled” means that these projects do not access each other's project model. 
Cross project configurations are a good example of this. 
Any use of the allprojects {} and subprojects {} closures 
will result in the projects being coupled. 

Android Studio does not use Parallel Mode by default, 
but you can enable it in Preferences > Compiler > Gradle.

Again, if you are using the command line you need to explicitly tell Gradle 
that you want to use Parallel Mode. 
To enable it, add the parallel property to your gradle.properties file:

org.gradle.parallel=true

Another helpful tip is to open preferences in Android Studio, 
click on Compiler and check the “Compile independent modules in parallel” checkbox
while also adding VM Options.  

I have had confirmation from a fellow Android developer of a very large Android app 
that took his compile time from 90 seconds down to 23 seconds.
