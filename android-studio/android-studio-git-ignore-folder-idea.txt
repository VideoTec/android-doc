So, to answer you question :

If you do not use something like Maven or Gradle to manage dependencies and build : 
keep the directory under version control. 
This way, the correct configuration of the project and dependencies 
will be available for everyone. 
In the counterpart, all developpers will have to set their environment 
exactly the same way that you define it in the config files.

If you do use something like Maven or Gradle : 
correctly configure these tools and do not keep the directory under version control. 
Actually, all the informations contained inside config files 
should be stored in Maven/Gradle files. 
Then let your developers configure their IDE depending of their environment. 
This way, using Eclipse, IntelliJ, Linux, Windows ... will not be a problem anymore.
