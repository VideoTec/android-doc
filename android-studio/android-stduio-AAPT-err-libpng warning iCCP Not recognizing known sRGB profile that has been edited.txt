从 OpenslTest Eclipse 工程里直接复制过来的图片，出现在下面的错误

AAPT err(1899704683): C:\Users\wangxiang\AndroidStudioProjects\MyApplication\app\src\main\res\mipmap-xhdpi\progress_bar_green_start.png: libpng warning: iCCP: Not recognizing known sRGB profile that has been edited

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26446610/android-gradle-project-upgrading-build-tools-to-21-0-1-aapt-throws-exception
原因是：

This is caused by a faulty aapt. 
There was a similer problem in 21.0.0 too (Error Code: -1073741819). 
You need to update build-tools again to fix it.

Open sdk manager and install build-tools 21.0.2.

Then change your build.gradle so that it looks like this.

apply plugin: 'com.android.application'
       android {
       compileSdkVersion 21
       buildToolsVersion "21.0.2"

可能是这个原因，但是，我遇到的情况是， 21.0.1 没有改变，只是重新编译就没问题了
不是没有问题了，需要 clean 后再编译，还出错

修改PNG文件
imagemagick 

At least for your drawables (PNG) you can take care by using "convert" or "mogrify" to remove the image profile sRGB as already described in one of the links (#8).
I would just like to add the correct command because the examples using "-strip" parameter remove ALL image profiles which is not necessary. 
To just remove the image profile sRGB use the following command:

mogrify +profile sRGB <png file>

or as batch command:

find <path to res folder> -name *.png -exec mogrify +profile sRGB {}  \;

After this most of the warnings will be gone but the warnings coming from PNGs inside the appcompat library will remain.


PS: isn't it weird to use "+profile" to remove profile?
