Whatever you do in IntelliJ IDEA, 
you do that in the context of a project. 
A project is an organizational unit that represents a complete software solution. 
It serves as a basis for 
1）coding assistance, 
2）bulk refactoring, 
3）coding style consistency, etc.

Your finished product may be decomposed into 
a series of discrete, isolated modules, 
but it's a project definition that 
brings them together and ties them into a greater whole.

Projects don't themselves contain development artifacts such as 
1）source code, 
2）build scripts, or 
3）documentation. 
They are the highest level of organization in the IDE, and 
they define project-wide settings as well as collections of 
what IntelliJ IDEA refers to as modules and libraries.
