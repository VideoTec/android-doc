versionCode â€” 
-------------------------------------

An integer used as an internal version number. 
This number is used only to determine whether one version is more recent than another, 
with higher numbers indicating more recent versions. 
This is not the version number shown to users; 
that number is set by the versionName setting, below.

The value is an integer so that other apps can programmatically evaluate it, 
for example to check an upgrade or downgrade relationship. 
You can set the value to any integer you want, 
however you should make sure that each successive release of your app uses a greater value. 
The system does not enforce this behavior, 
but increasing the value with successive releases is normative.

Typically, 
you would release the first version of your app with versionCode set to 1, 
then monotonically increase the value with each release, 
regardless whether the release constitutes a major or minor release. 
This means that the versionCode value does not necessarily have a strong resemblance 
to the app release version that is visible to the user (see versionName, below). 
Apps and publishing services should not display this version value to users.

Warning: 
The greatest possible value for versionCode is MAXINT (2147483647). 
However, if you upload an app with this value, your app can't ever be updated.

-------------------------------------
versionName
-------------------------------------
A string used as the version number shown to users. 
This setting can be specified as a raw string or as a reference to a string resource.

The value is a string so that you can describe the app version as a 
<major>.<minor>.<point> string, 
or as any other type of absolute or relative version identifier. 
The versionName has no purpose other than to be displayed to users.
