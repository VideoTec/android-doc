把 BuildVariants 设置成 xxRelease 后， 再点 debug 按钮时的错误提示：

11:27:40 Error running rongflymqtt
         Cannot debug application from module rongflymqtt on device samsung-gt_i9308-3230911981727f4f.
         This application does not have the debuggable attribute enabled in its manifest.
         If you have manually set it in the manifest, then remove it and let the IDE automatically assign it.
         If you are using Gradle, make sure that your current variant is debuggable.

除了签名信息不同外，并没什么本质的区别。
签名主要是用于标识这个apk是那个公司开发的而已。
eclipse就是按照你所说的方式打包的

All applications must be signed. 
The system will not install an application on an emulator or a device if it is not signed.

To test and debug your application, 
the build tools sign your application with a special debug key 
that is created by the Android SDK build tools.

When you are ready to release your application for end-users, 
you must sign it with a suitable private key. 
You cannot publish an application that is signed with the debug key generated by the SDK tools.

You can use self-signed certificates to sign your applications. 
No certificate authority is needed.
