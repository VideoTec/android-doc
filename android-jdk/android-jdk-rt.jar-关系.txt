The Android Platform Runtime Environment 
is similar to common (Oracle or OpenJDK) Java Runtime Environment 
but it is not the same.

Therefore classes that exist in Java 1.6/1.7/1.8 
may exist on Android as well but they can also be missing. 
If they exist you can use them if not you can't.

The package java.nio.file.* 
for example is not available on Android. 
If you have code that requires this package you have to rewrite it.

Even if the Java Runtime is added by default to your project 
as external library this is done only for compatibility reasons. 
You can not use classes from this library.
