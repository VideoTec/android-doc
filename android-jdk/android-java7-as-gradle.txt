Java 7 support was added at build tools 19. You can now use features like the diamond operator, multi-catch, try-with-resources, strings in switches, etc. Add the following to your build.gradle.

android {
    compileSdkVersion 19
    buildToolsVersion "19.0.0"

    defaultConfig {
        minSdkVersion 7
        targetSdkVersion 19
    }

    compileOptions {
        sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_7
        targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_7
    }
}

Gradle 1.7+, Android gradle plugin 0.6.+ are required.
Note, that only try with resources require minSdkVersion 19. 
Other features works on previous platforms.
