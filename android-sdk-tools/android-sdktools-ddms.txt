Android ships with a debugging tool called the Dalvik Debug Monitor Server (DDMS), 
which provides 
port-forwarding services, 
screen capture on the device, 
thread and heap information on the device, 
logcat, process, and radio state information, incoming call and SMS spoofing, 
location data spoofing, and more. 

This page provides a modest discussion of DDMS features; 
it is not an exhaustive exploration of all the features and capabilities.

From the command line: Type ddms (or ./ddms on Mac/Linux) from the tools/ directory
