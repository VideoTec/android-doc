To create an Android project, you must use the android tool. 
When you create a new project with android, 
it will generate a project directory 
with some default application files, stub files, configuration files and a build file.

android create project \
--target <target_ID> \            target-id 和 sdk 的对应关系可以通过， android.bat list targets 查看
--name <your_project_name> \      可先项
--path path/to/your/project \
--activity <your_activity_name> \
--package <your_package_namespace>

target is the "build target" for your application. 
It corresponds to an Android platform library (including any add-ons, such as Google APIs) 
that you would like to build your project against. 
To see a list of available targets and their corresponding IDs, execute: android list targets.

name is the name for your project. This is optional. 
If provided, this name will be used for your .apk filename when you build your application.

path is the location of your project directory. 
If the directory does not exist, it will be created for you.

activity is the name for your default Activity class. 
This class file will be created for you inside <path_to_your_project>/src/<your_package_namespace_path>/ . 
This will also be used for your .apk filename unless you provide a name.

package is the package namespace for your project, 
following the same rules as for packages in the Java programming language.
