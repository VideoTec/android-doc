The Android Support Library package is a set of code libraries that 
provide backward-compatible versions of Android framework APIs 
as well as features that are only available through the library APIs. 

Each Support Library is backward-compatible to a specific Android API level. 
This design means that your applications 
can use the libraries' features and 
still be compatible with devices running Android 1.6 (API level 4) and up.

This guide provides information about what features are enabled by the Support Libraries, 
how to use them in your development environment and information about library releases.

Including the Support Libraries in your Android project is considered 
a best practice for application developers, 
depending on the range of platform versions your app is targeting and the APIs that it uses. 

Using the features the libraries provide can help you improve the look of your application, 
increase performance and broaden the reach of your application to more users. 
If you use the Android code template tools, 
you will notice that all the Android application templates 
include one or more of the Support Libraries by default.

The Support Libraries each target a base Android API level and each provides a different set of features. 
In order to effectively use the libraries, 
it is important to consider what features you want to support and 
understand what features are supported by each library at what Android API level. 

To get started, review the Support Library Features guide. 

After that, go to the Support Library Setup topic to learn 
how to incorporate the Support Libraries into your application. 

For more details about Support Library APIs, see the android.support packages in the API reference.

添加 Support Library

在添加一个Support Library到你的项目之前，想好你要包含哪些功能，
以及你要支持的最低Android版本是多少
