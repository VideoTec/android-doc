1）Setting Application Version
2）Specifying Your Application's System API Requirements

Versioning is a critical component of your application upgrade and 
maintenance strategy. Versioning is important because:

1）Users need to have specific information 
about the application version that is installed on their devices and 
the upgrade versions available for installation.

2）Other applications — 
including other applications that you publish as a suite — 
need to query the system for your application's version, 
to determine compatibility and identify dependencies.

3）Services through which you will publish your application(s) 
may also need to query your application for its version, 
so that they can display the version to users. 
A publishing service may also need to 
check the application version to determine compatibility and 
establish upgrade/downgrade relationships.

The Android system does not use app version information 
to enforce restrictions 
on upgrades, downgrades, or compatibility of third-party apps. 
Instead, you (the developer) are responsible 
for enforcing version restrictions within your application or 
by informing users of the version restrictions and limitations. 
The Android system does, however, enforce system version compatibility 
as expressed by the minSdkVersion attribute in the manifest. 
This attribute allows an application to specify the minimum system API 
with which it is compatible.
