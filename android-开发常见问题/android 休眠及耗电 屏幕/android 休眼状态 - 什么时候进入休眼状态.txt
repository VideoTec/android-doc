You can never really be sure if the device has gone to sleep. At best, I can give you a list of things that would make sure that the device hasn't gone to sleep:

Screen being on - Requires CPU and GPU, and hence RAM, to stay active
Any app holding a wakelock - Even the lowest wakelocks keep the CPU on, though the screen may be switched off
Apart from this, there is no guarantee that the device will go to sleep n seconds after the screen is turned off, even if no wakelocks are being held. This is upto the OEM, and they can alter this.

Keep in mind that Android devices have an option to keep the device unlocked for a certain amount of time after the screen has gone to sleep.
