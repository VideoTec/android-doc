-------------------------------------------------
I'm sure the workaround isn't too difficult
-------------------------------------------------
Using AlarmManager is a bit tricky.

-------------------------------------------------
My question is what exactly does "sleep mode" do on android systems?
-------------------------------------------------
Primarily, it shuts down the CPU. Along the way, non-essential radios (WiFi, GPS) will have been shut down as well.

-------------------------------------------------
What does it stop, what doesn't it stop, etc.
-------------------------------------------------
About the only thing you can count on not stopping is the GSM or CDMA radio (for incoming calls, SMSes, and IP packets) and AlarmManager.

-------------------------------------------------
By sleep mode I mean, of course, when you press the power button and the screen goes black.
-------------------------------------------------
Actually, that's not sleep mode, per se. That is the screen turning off.

The device will go into sleep mode shortly thereafter, if nothing is keeping it awake with a WakeLock. However, there is no guarantee that within a millisecond of you pressing that button and the screen turning off that the CPU is off.
