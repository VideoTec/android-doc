Now even when your phone goes into standby mode, 
you'll stay connected to Wifi and be able to get mail and messages without turning the cell radio back on and trouncing your battery life. 
And for the times when you're not in an area with a Wifi connection, 
just shut Wifi off, either through the menu or with a handy toggle widget.  
Your battery will thank you for it.
