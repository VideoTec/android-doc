In the startService (Intent service) documentation it says:

Using startService() overrides the default service lifetime that is managed bybindService(Intent, ServiceConnection, int): 
it requires the service to remain running until stopService(Intent) is called, 
regardless of whether any clients are connected to it. 
Note that calls to startService() are not nesting: 
no matter how many times you callstartService(), 
a single call to stopService(Intent) will stop it.
