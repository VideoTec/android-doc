boolean bindService (Intent service, 
                ServiceConnection conn, 
                int flags)

The documentation is incorrect. 
When returned boolean is false this means that 
no further attempts to establish connection are made. 
When true is returned this means that system tries to establish a connection and 
this can succeed or fail.

Look at answer for this question: "in what case does bindservice return false". 
Basically bindservice returns false 
when it does not find a service to even attempt to bind to.
