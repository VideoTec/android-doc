是由于内存溢出造成的

The inflate exception is not actually the problem, 
but really comes from another deeper issue in your layout 
that is then wrapped in an InflateException. 
A common issue is an out of memory 
exception when trying to inflate an imageview loading a drawable resource. 
If one of this resources has a high pixel resolution 
it would take a lot of memory causing then an inflate exception.

So basically verify that the pixel resolution 
in your drawables images are just the minimum necessary for your layout.
