onCreateContextMenu

Added in API level 1
void onCreateContextMenu (ContextMenu menu, 
                View v, 
                ContextMenu.ContextMenuInfo menuInfo)
                
Called when a context menu for the view is about to be shown. 
Unlike onCreateOptionsMenu(Menu), 
this will be called every time the context menu 
is about to be shown and should be populated for the view 
(or item inside the view for AdapterView subclasses, this can be found in the menuInfo)).

Use onContextItemSelected(android.view.MenuItem) 
to know when an item has been selected.

It is not safe to hold onto the context menu after this method returns.

Parameters

menu
ContextMenu: The context menu that is being built

v
View: The view for which the context menu is being built

menuInfo
ContextMenu.ContextMenuInfo: 
Extra information about the item for which the context menu should be shown. 
This information will vary depending on the class of v.
