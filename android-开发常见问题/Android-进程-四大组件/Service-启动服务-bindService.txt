理解 bindService 的关键是
1. 服务端 onBind 返回的 IBinder 对象怎么创建的
2. 客户端 onServiceConnected 怎么处理绑定的 IBinder 对象

bindService

Added in API level 1
boolean bindService (Intent service, 
                ServiceConnection conn, 
                int flags)
                
Connect to an application service, 
creating it if needed. 
This defines a dependency between your application and the service. 
The given conn will receive the service object when it is created and be told if it dies and restarts. 
The service will be considered required by the system 
only for as long as the calling context exists. 

For example, 
if this Context is an Activity that is stopped, 
the service will not be required to continue running until the Activity is resumed.

This function will throw SecurityException 
if you do not have permission to bind to the given service.

---------------------------------------------------
Note: 
---------------------------------------------------

this method can not be called from a BroadcastReceiver component. 
A pattern you can use to communicate from a BroadcastReceiver to a Service 
is to call startService(Intent) with the arguments containing the command to be sent, 
with the service calling its stopSelf(int) method when done executing that command. 

See the API demo App/Service/Service Start Arguments Controller 
for an illustration of this. 
It is okay, however, to use this method from a BroadcastReceiver 
that has been registered with registerReceiver(BroadcastReceiver, IntentFilter), 
since the lifetime of this BroadcastReceiver is tied to another object 
(the one that registered it).

---------------------------------------------------
参数: Intent service 
---------------------------------------------------

service	Intent: 
Identifies the service to connect to. 
The Intent may specify either an explicit component name, 
or a logical description (action, category, etc) 
to match an IntentFilter published by a service.

---------------------------------------------------
参数: ServiceConnection conn 
---------------------------------------------------

conn	ServiceConnection: 
Receives information as the service is started and stopped. 
This must be a valid ServiceConnection object; 
it must not be null.

举例： mConn 用来监听连接服务的事件

bindService(intent, mConn, Context.BIND_AUTO_CREATE);

private ServiceConnection mConn = new ServiceConnection()
{
    @Override
    public void onServiceConnected(ComponentName name, IBinder service)
    {
        mService = new Messenger(service);
        isConn = true;
        mTvState.setText("connected!");
    }

    @Override
    public void onServiceDisconnected(ComponentName name)
    {
        mService = null;
        isConn = false;
        mTvState.setText("disconnected!");
    }
};

---------------------------------------------------
参数: int flags 
---------------------------------------------------

flags	int: 
Operation options for the binding. 
May be 
0, 
BIND_AUTO_CREATE, 
BIND_DEBUG_UNBIND, 
BIND_NOT_FOREGROUND, 
BIND_ABOVE_CLIENT, 
BIND_ALLOW_OOM_MANAGEMENT, or 
BIND_WAIVE_PRIORITY.
