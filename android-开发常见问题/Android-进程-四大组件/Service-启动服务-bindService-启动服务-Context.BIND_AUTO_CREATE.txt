Perhaps try adding "Context.BIND_AUTO_CREATE" to the flags, 
which will cause the service to be created and started. 
I don't believe that Context.BIND_ADJUST_WITH_ACTIVITY will start it, 
so the onServiceConnected may not be called 
(it wasn't for me even though the bindService() call was returning true):

参考：
D:\doc\android\android-开发常见问题\Android-进程-四大组件\Service-启动服务-bindService-参数-flags.txt

Context.BIND_AUTO_CREATE does not start the service, it only creates it.

即
如果，服务所在进程没有启动，不会启动服务进程。
