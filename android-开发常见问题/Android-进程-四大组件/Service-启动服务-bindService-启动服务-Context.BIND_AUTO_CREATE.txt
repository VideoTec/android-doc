Perhaps try adding "Context.BIND_AUTO_CREATE" to the flags, 
which will cause the service to be created and started. 
I don't believe that Context.BIND_ADJUST_WITH_ACTIVITY will start it, 
so the onServiceConnected may not be called 
(it wasn't for me even though the bindService() call was returning true):
