关于广播中
不能绑定服务和
不能注册广播

一、BroadcastReceiver components are not allowed to bind to services
要在绑定服务前面加上红色字体的语句；
context.getApplicationContext().bindService(gattServiceIntent, mServiceConnection, Context.BIND_AUTO_CREATE);

二、 android.content.ReceiverCallNotAllowedException: IntentReceiver components are not allowed to register to receive intents解决方法：
registerReceiver不能在BroadcastReceiver调用，
可以通过context.getApplicationContext().registerReceiver();解决。

Note: this method can not be called from a BroadcastReceiver component. 
A pattern you can use to communicate from a BroadcastReceiver to a Service 
is to call startService(Intent) with the arguments containing the command to be sent, 
with the service calling its stopSelf(int) method when done executing that command.

IBinder peekService (Context myContext, 
                Intent service)
                
Provide a binder to an already-running service. 
This method is synchronous and will not start the target service if it is not present, 
so it is safe to call from onReceive(Context, Intent).
