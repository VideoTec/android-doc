By default, AIDL supports the following data types:

All primitive types in the Java programming language (such as int, long, char, boolean, and so on)

String
CharSequence

List

All elements in the List must be 
one of the supported data types in this list 
or 
one of the other AIDL-generated interfaces or parcelables you've declared. 

A List may optionally be used as a "generic" class (for example, List<String>). 
The actual concrete class that the other side receives is always an ArrayList,
although the method is generated to use the List interface.

Map

All elements in the Map must be 
one of the supported data types in this list or 
one of the other AIDL-generated interfaces or parcelables you've declared. Generic maps, 
(such as those of the form Map<String,Integer> are not supported. 
The actual concrete class that the other side receives is always a HashMap, 
although the method is generated to use the Map interface.
