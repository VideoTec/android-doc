Develop - API Guides - App Components - Process and Threads

When an application component starts and 
the application does not have any other components running, 
the Android system starts a new Linux process for the application 
with a single thread of execution. 

By default, all components of the same application 
run in the same process and thread (called the "main" thread). 
If an application component starts and 
there already exists a process for that application 
(because another component from the application exists), 
then the component is started within that process and 
uses the same thread of execution. 
However, you can arrange for different components 
in your application to run in separate processes, 
and you can create additional threads for any process.

This document discusses how processes and threads work in an Android application.
