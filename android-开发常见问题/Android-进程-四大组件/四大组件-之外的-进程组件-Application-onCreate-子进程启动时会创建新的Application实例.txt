Application is initialized multi-times 
when there were multiple processes in Android.

I think that you have additional process in your application. 
That is why Application.onCreate is called more than once. 

Look into your manifest file and try to find the activity or service 
with something like android:process= . 
This means that activity/service is starting in second Dalvik VM, 
and that's why another application instance is created

一般来说Application的onCreate方法只会执行一次，
如果应用中采用多进程方式，oncreate方法会执行多次，根据不同的进程名字进行不同的初始化，
就是在application中多添加几个if else
