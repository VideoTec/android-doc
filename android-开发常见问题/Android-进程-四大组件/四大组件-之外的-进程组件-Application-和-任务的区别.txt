A common misunderstanding about Android multitasking 
is the difference between a process and an application. 

In Android these are not tightly coupled entities: 
applications may seem present to the user 
without an actual process currently running the app; 
multiple applications may share processes, 
or one application may make use of multiple processes depending on its needs;
the process(es) of an application may be kept around 
by Android even when that application is not actively doing something.
