You must include an import statement for each additional type not listed above, 
even if they are defined in the same package as your interface.

When defining your service interface, be aware that:

1）Methods can take zero or more parameters, and return a value or void.

2）All non-primitive parameters require 
a directional tag indicating which way the data goes. 
Either in, out, or inout (see the example below).
Primitives are in by default, and cannot be otherwise.

Caution: You should limit the direction to what is truly needed, 
because marshalling parameters is expensive.

adj.编组的，集结待发的

3）All code comments included in the .aidl file 
are included in the generated IBinder interface 
(except for comments before the import and package statements).

4）Only methods are supported; 
you cannot expose static fields in AIDL.
