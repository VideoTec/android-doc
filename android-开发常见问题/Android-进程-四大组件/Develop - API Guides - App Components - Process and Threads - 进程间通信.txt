Interprocess Communication

Android offers a mechanism for interprocess communication (IPC) 
using remote procedure calls (RPCs), 
in which a method is called by an activity or other application component, 
but executed remotely (in another process), 
with any result returned back to the caller. 

This entails decomposing a method call and its data 
to a level the operating system can understand, 

transmitting it 
from the local process and address space 
to   the remote process and address space, 
then reassembling and reenacting the call there. 

Return values are then transmitted in the opposite direction. 
Android provides all the code to perform these IPC transactions, 
so you can focus on defining and implementing the RPC programming interface.

To perform IPC, 
your application must bind to a service, using bindService().
