public void onCreate ()

Added in API level 1

Called when the application is starting, 
before any 
activity, service, or receiver objects 
(excluding content providers) have been created. 

Implementations should be as quick as possible 
(for example using lazy initialization of state) 
since the time spent in this function 
directly impacts the performance of 
starting the first activity, service, or receiver in a process. 
If you override this method, be sure to call super.onCreate().
