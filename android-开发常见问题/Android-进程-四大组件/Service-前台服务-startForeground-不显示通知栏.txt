As a security feature of the Android platform, 
you cannot, under any circumstance, 
have a foregrounded service without also having a notification. 
This is because a foregrounded service consumes a heavier amount of resources and 
is subject to different scheduling constraints 
(i.e., it doesn't get killed as quickly) than background services, 
and the user needs to know what's possibly eating their battery. 
So, don't do this.

However, 
it is possible to have a "fake" notification, 
i.e., you can make a transparent notification icon (iirc). 
This is extremely disingenuous to your users, 
and you have no reason to do it, 
other than killing their battery and thus creating malware.

I've made peace with the fact the notification itself 
still needs to be there but for who ever who still wants to hide it, 
I may have found a workaround for that as well:

Start a fake service with startForeground() with the notification and everything.
Start the real service you want to run, 
also with startForeground() (same notification ID)

Stop the first (fake) service 
(you can call stopSelf() and in onDestroy call stopForeground(true)).
Voilà! No notification at all and your second service keeps running.

I just noticed that startForeground() 
doesn't show the notification icon if the id parameter is set to 0...

startForeground(0, notification); // Doesn't work...

startForeground(1, notification); // Works!!!
I hope that it could help someone stuck on this.

不管用。。。设为0就能杀掉了。。。 --- 也就是，服务不是前台服务。

Settings icon to 0 doesn't work anymore (in 4.3)

 If you really need a foreground service, the user have the right to know.
