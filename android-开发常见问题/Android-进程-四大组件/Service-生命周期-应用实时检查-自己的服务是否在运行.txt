How do I check if a background service (on Android) is running?

I want an Android activity that toggles the state of the service -- 
it lets me turn it on if it is off and off if it is on.

private boolean isMyServiceRunning(Class<?> serviceClass) {
    ActivityManager manager = (ActivityManager) getSystemService(Context.ACTIVITY_SERVICE);
    for (RunningServiceInfo service : manager.getRunningServices(Integer.MAX_VALUE)) {
        if (serviceClass.getName().equals(service.service.getClassName())) {
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}

This works reliably, 
because it is based on the information about running services provided 
by the Android operating system through 
ActivityManager#getRunningServices.
http://developer.android.com/intl/zh-cn/reference/android/app/ActivityManager.html#getRunningServices%28int%29

All the approaches using onDestroy 
or onSometing events or Binders or static variables 
will not work reliably 
because as a developer you never know, 
when Android decides to kill your process or 
which of the mentioned callbacks are called or not. 

Please note the "killable" column 
in the lifecycle events table in the Android documentation.
