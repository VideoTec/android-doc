Some developers use custom subclasses of Application for their own global data, 
which they retrieve via getApplicationContext(). 

That's certainly possible. 
I prefer static data members, 
if for no other reason than you can only have one custom Application object. 
I built one app using a custom Application object and found it to be painful. 
Ms. Hackborn also agrees with this position.

I very much recommend singletons. 
If you have a singleton that needs a context, have:

MySingleton.getInstance(Context c) {
    //
    // ... needing to create ...
    sInstance = new MySingleton(c.getApplicationContext());
}
