Added in API level 1
void setResult (int resultCode, 
                Intent data)

Call this to set the result that your activity will return to its caller.

下面这一大段，参考：
Activity-startActivityForResult-官方文档-获取Activity的结果.txt
最后的例子，startActivityForResult 获取用户选择的联系人的 uri
再用 uri 获取用户的电话号码

As of GINGERBREAD, 
the Intent you supply here can have 
Intent.FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION and/or 
Intent.FLAG_GRANT_WRITE_URI_PERMISSION set. 

This will grant the Activity 
receiving the result access to the specific URIs in the Intent. 
Access will remain until the Activity has finished 
(it will remain across the hosting process being killed and other temporary destruction) 
and will be added to any existing set of URI permissions it already holds.

Parameters

resultCode
int: The result code to propagate back to the originating activity, 
often RESULT_CANCELED or RESULT_OK

data
Intent: The data to propagate back to the originating activity.
