https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context.html#bindService(android.content.Intent, android.content.ServiceConnection, int)

The service will be considered required 
by the system only for as long as the calling context exists. 
For example, 
if this Context is an Activity that is stopped, 
the service will not be required to continue running until the Activity is resumed.
