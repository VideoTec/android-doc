MediaScannerConnection provides 
a way for applications to pass a newly created or 
downloaded media file to the media scanner service. 
The media scanner service will read metadata from the file 
and add the file to the media content provider. 
The MediaScannerConnectionClient provides an interface 
for the media scanner service to return the Uri 
for a newly scanned file to the client of the MediaScannerConnection class.
