This lesson describes how to use the Android Support Library to check for, and request, permissions. The Android framework provides similar methods as of Android 6.0 (API level 23). However, using the support library is simpler, since your app doesn't need to check which version of Android it's running on before calling the methods.

Check For Permissions

If your app needs a dangerous permission, you must check whether you have that permission every time you perform an operation that requires that permission. The user is always free to revoke the permission, so even if the app used the camera yesterday, it can't assume it still has that permission today.

To check if you have a permission, call the ContextCompat.checkSelfPermission() method. For example, this snippet shows how to check if the activity has permission to write to the calendar:

// Assume thisActivity is the current activity
int permissionCheck = ContextCompat.checkSelfPermission(thisActivity,
        Manifest.permission.WRITE_CALENDAR);
        
If the app has the permission, the method returns PackageManager.PERMISSION_GRANTED, and the app can proceed with the operation. If the app does not have the permission, the method returns PERMISSION_DENIED, and the app has to explicitly ask the user for permission.
