This new permission system may cause you some panic right now. 
"Hey ! What's about my application that launched 3 years ago. 
If it is installed on Android 6.0 device, does this behavior also applied? Will my application also crash?!?"

Don't worry. Android team has already thought about it. 
If the application's targetSdkVersion is set to less than 23. 
It will be assumed that application 
is not tested with new permission system yet and will switch to the same old behavior: 
user has to accept every single permission at install time and they will be all granted once installed !

当用户主动禁止某个权限后：（返回 Null 或者 0， 不会 crash）

Such a kindness sent from god delivered through the Android team. 
When we call a function that requires a permission user revoked on application with targetSdkVersion less than 23, 
no any Exception will be thrown. 
Instead it will just simply do nothing. 
For the function that return value, it will return either null or 0 depends on the case.
