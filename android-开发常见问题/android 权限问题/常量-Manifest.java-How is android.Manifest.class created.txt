I'm not aware of any android.Manifest.java file, 
but when compiling AOSP there is a couple of Manifest.java files created automatically.

Perhaps this one is the one you're looking for? 
It seems to correspond to what's in android.jar (API 16)

Manifest.class
Manifest$permission.class
Manifest$permission_group.class

Located at ./out/target/common/R/android/Manifest.java

And there's also a Manifest.java in the sources directory for the API-level 
(in the SDK); android-sdk\sources\android-16\java\util\jar\, 
that might be the one you're looking for?
