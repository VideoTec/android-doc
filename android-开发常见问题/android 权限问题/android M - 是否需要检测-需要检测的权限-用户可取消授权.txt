下面这些权限是不是 Normal Permission

The big reason for not getting your permission nowadays is 
because your project has a targetSdkVersion of 23 or higher, 
and the permission that you are requesting is "dangerous". In Android 6.0, this includes:

ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION
ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION
ADD_VOICEMAIL
BODY_SENSORS
CALL_PHONE
CAMERA
GET_ACCOUNTS
PROCESS_OUTGOING_CALLS
READ_CALENDAR
READ_CALL_LOG
READ_CELL_BROADCASTS
READ_CONTACTS
READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE
READ_PHONE_STATE
READ_SMS
RECEIVE_MMS
RECEIVE_SMS
RECEIVE_WAP_PUSH
RECORD_AUDIO
SEND_SMS
USE_SIP
WRITE_CALENDAR
WRITE_CALL_LOG
WRITE_CONTACTS
WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE

For these permissions, not only does your targetSdkVersion 23+ app need to have the <uses-permission> element(s), but you also have to ask for those permissions at runtime from the user on Android 6.0+ devices, using methods like checkSelfPermission() and requestPermissions().

As a temporary workaround, drop your targetSdkVersion below 23.

However, eventually, you will have some reason to want your targetSdkVersion to be 23 or higher. At that time, you will need to adjust your app to use the new runtime permission system. The Android documentation has a page dedicated to this topic.
