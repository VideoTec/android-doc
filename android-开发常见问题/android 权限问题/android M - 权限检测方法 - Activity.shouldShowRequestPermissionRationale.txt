public boolean shouldShowRequestPermissionRationale (String permission)

Added in API level 23
Gets whether you should show UI with rationale for requesting a permission. You should do this only if you do not have the permission and the context in which the permission is requested does not clearly communicate to the user what would be the benefit from granting this permission.

For example, if you write a camera app, requesting the camera permission would be expected by the user and no rationale for why it is requested is needed. If however, the app needs location for tagging photos then a non-tech savvy user may wonder how location is related to taking photos. In this case you may choose to show UI with rationale of requesting this permission.

Parameters
permission	String: A permission your app wants to request.
Returns
boolean	Whether you can show permission rationale UI.
