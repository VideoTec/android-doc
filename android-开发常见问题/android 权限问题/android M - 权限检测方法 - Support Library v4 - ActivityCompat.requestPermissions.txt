ActivityCompat.requestPermissions()

If this function is called on pre-M, 
OnRequestPermissionsResultCallback will be suddenly called 
with correct PERMISSION_GRANTED or PERMISSION_DENIED result.

http://developer.android.com/intl/zh-cn/reference/android/support/v4/app/ActivityCompat.html#requestPermissions(android.app.Activity, java.lang.String[], int)

public static void requestPermissions 
(Activity activity, String[] permissions, int requestCode - 用来区分请求来源)

Requests permissions to be granted to this application. 
These permissions must be requested in your manifest, 
they should not be granted to your app, 
and they should have protection level #PROTECTION_DANGEROUS dangerous, 
regardless whether they are declared by the platform or a third-party app.

Normal permissions PROTECTION_NORMAL 
are granted at install time if requested in the manifest. 
Signature permissions PROTECTION_SIGNATURE are granted at install time 
if requested in the manifest and the signature of your app 
matches the signature of the app declaring the permissions.

If your app does not have the requested permissions 
the user will be presented with UI for accepting them. 
After the user has accepted or rejected the requested permissions 
you will receive a callback reporting whether the permissions were granted or not. 
Your activity has to implement ActivityCompat.OnRequestPermissionsResultCallback and 
the results of permission requests will be delivered 
to its onRequestPermissionsResult(int, String[], int[]) method.

Note that requesting a permission does not guarantee 
it will be granted and your app should be able to run without having this permission.

This method 
may start an activity allowing the user to choose 
which permissions to grant and which to reject. 
Hence, you should be prepared that your activity may be paused and resumed. 
Further, granting some permissions may require a restart of you application. 
In such a case, 
the system will recreate the activity stack 
before delivering the result to your onRequestPermissionsResult( int, String[], int[]).

When checking whether you have a permission 
you should use checkSelfPermission(android.content.Context, String).

Parameters

activity
Activity: The target activity.

permissions
String: The requested permissions.

requestCode
int: Application specific request code to match 
with a result reported to onRequestPermissionsResult(int, String[], int[]).
