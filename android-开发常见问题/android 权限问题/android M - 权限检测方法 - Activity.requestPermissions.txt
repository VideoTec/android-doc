public final void requestPermissions (String[] permissions, int requestCode)

Added in API level 23
Requests permissions to be granted to this application. 
These permissions must be requested in your manifest, 
they should not be granted to your app, 
and they should have protection level #PROTECTION_DANGEROUS dangerous, 
regardless whether they are declared by the platform or a third-party app.

Normal permissions PROTECTION_NORMAL are granted at install time if requested in the manifest. 
Signature permissions PROTECTION_SIGNATURE are granted at install time 
if requested in the manifest and the signature 
of your app matches the signature 
of the app declaring the permissions.

If your app does not have the requested permissions 
the user will be presented with UI for accepting them. 
After the user has accepted or rejected the requested permissions 
you will receive a callback on onRequestPermissionsResult(int, String[], int[]) 
reporting whether the permissions were granted or not.

Note that requesting a permission does not guarantee 
it will be granted and your app should be able to run without having this permission.

This method may start an activity allowing the user to choose 
which permissions to grant and which to reject. 
Hence, you should be prepared that your activity may be paused and resumed. 
Further, granting some permissions may require a restart of you application. 
In such a case, the system will recreate the activity stack 
before delivering the result to onRequestPermissionsResult(int, String[], int[]).

When checking whether you have a permission you should use checkSelfPermission(String).

You cannot request a permission if your activity sets noHistory to true 
because in this case the activity would not receive result callbacks 
including onRequestPermissionsResult(int, String[], int[]).

The RuntimePermissions sample app demonstrates 
how to use this method to request permissions at run time.

Parameters

permissions String: 
The requested permissions.

requestCode int: 
Application specific request code to match 
with a result reported to onRequestPermissionsResult(int, String[], int[]). Should be >= 0.
