All apps (root or not) have a default data directory, 
which is /data/data/<package_name>. 

By default, the apps databases, 
settings, and all other data go here. 

If an app expects huge amounts of data to be stored, 
or for other reasons wants to "be nice to internal storage", 
there's a corresponding directory on the SDCard (Android/data/<package_name>).

/data/data/<package_name> (and corresponding SD-part):

databases/: here go the app's databases
lib/: libraries and helpers for the app
files/: other related files
shared_prefs/: preferences and settings
cache/: well, caches
