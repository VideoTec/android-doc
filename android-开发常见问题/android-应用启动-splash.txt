The very idea of the splash screen makes me a little angry. 
Just saying the phrase makes me cringe.
Splash screens just waste your time, right? 
As an Android developer, when I see a splash screen, 
I know that some poor dev had to add a three-second delay to the code.

Then, 
I have to stare at some picture for three seconds until I can use the app. 
And I have to do this every time it’s launched. I know which app I opened. 
I know what it does. Just let me use it!

Armed with this knowledge, make your splash screen work the right way. 
Don’t waste the user’s time, 
but give them something nice to look at while they wait.
