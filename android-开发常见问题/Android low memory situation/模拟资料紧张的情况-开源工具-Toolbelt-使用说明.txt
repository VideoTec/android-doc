How to Test Your App

There are three main ways this tool can be used to test your app:

1）Testing your Application/Activities being placed into background.

2）Testing your process being killed 
(i.e. everything in memory, including all static variables will be removed).

3）Testing your app while under memory pressure 
(maybe more useful for games).

To test cases 1 & 2, use the instructions below. 
For testing while under memory pressure, 
just don't press the stop button 
(unfortunately this can sometimes lead to freezing issues on some devices)[2].

Start your application and build up some state 
you want to test i.e. play with it a little.

Start this app & tap the Fill Memory button. 
You'll see the memory counter decrease. 
When it hits a point when it seemingly 
cannot go any lower or the low memory indicator is true[2], 
your app has probably[3] been placed into a background state.

Press the Stop button and 
return to your app to ensure all state has been properly restored.

[1] I'm planning on adding a Pause button soon, 
so that the memory level can be kept constant - 
which should make this kind of testing much easier.

[2] Not all devices will be able 
to reach the state where the 'Low Memory' indicator is true. 
This is an indicator for the operating system as a whole, 
not specific applications. 
Your app can still be placed into background as normal 
(when the indicator can't seem to go much lower).

[3] Android kills applications using different criteria - 
I can't guarantee when it will kill your app, 
the longer you wait, the more likely your app has been killed. 
When you notice the RAM counter bouncing up and down (~10% mark on a Nexus 5), 
you know that Android is freeing up memory by killing applications & services.
