If you take a look at the source code for dumpsys, you can see that it simply requests a instance of the service from the default service manager and then calls the service dump() method (which is an interface of IBinder) passing STDOUT and the command line args:

sp<IServiceManager> sm = defaultServiceManager();
...
sp<IBinder> service = sm->checkService(services[i]);
...
int err = service->dump(STDOUT_FILENO, args); 
In your example above, the service in question would appear to have been renamed from batteryinfo to batterystats
