Polling 的缺点：
Polling is generally an unsatisfactory compromise. 
Polling infrequently results in an application 
which can appear slow to respond to changes in the data – 
for example, 
polling every 30 minutes could potentially result in an application 
which takes 29 minutes before it notices the queried data has changed.
 
Polling very frequently mitigates this, 
but at the cost of increasing the app’s battery usage.

最好的方法：等待服务通知
It’s better for the mobile app to do neither – and simply 
wait for the server to tell it when the data changes.
