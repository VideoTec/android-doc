用 MQTT connection 代替 raw TCP/IP connection
----------------------------------------------------
my idea consists of 
1）taking a KeepAliveService and 
2）replacing the raw TCP/IP connection with an MQTT connection. 

In this case, each device can simply 
subscribe to a unique topic which is based on its device ID. 
Now, assuming that your server knows the device ID, 
it can push data to the device over MQTT by publishing to that unique topic.
