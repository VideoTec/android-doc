First off, you have to be careful with recording calls 
as there are legal requirements depending on the country.

Here is a blog post on how to record audio using the MediaRecorder.

I haven't tried recording phone call's but there is a option in MediaRecorder AudioSource for:

VOICE_CALL - Voice call uplink + downlink audio source
VOICE_DOWNLINK - Voice call downlink (Rx) audio source
VOICE_UPLINK - Voice call uplink (Tx) audio source

As long as the audio source options work, you should be good to go.
