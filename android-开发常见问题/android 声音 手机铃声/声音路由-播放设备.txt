Other unmentioned thing is which audio device will produce a sound.

Using STREAM_MUSIC 
the sound will be produced through one audio device
(phone speaker, earphone, bluetooth speaker or something else) connected to the phone.

Using STREAM_RING 
the sound will be produced through all audio device connected to the phone. 

This behaviour might be differed for each devices.
