I there a way to view for debug purpose a list of the active PendingIntents in a device?

I am starting to work with AlarmManager and I like to see 
if my PendingIntents are created and removed correctly.

It would also be nice to see what other PendingIntents are there, 
just as a curiosity to see if some app is doing some "extra work".

adb shell dumpsys alarm > dump.txt
