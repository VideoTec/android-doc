In case of device sleep, activity's `onPause()' will be called. 
Read activity lifecycle to understand this.

OS only kills the process when memory/resources are low. 
Activities are killed first, services are only killed as last resort.

But there is no guarantee they will not be killed. 
This is why you should rely on system services to call you 
when you need some work done: 
1）use AlarmManager to do call your code periodically or 
2）use listeners to notify you of system changes (gps, network, etc..)
