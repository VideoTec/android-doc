Device is asleep when there is not running application that prevents it from sleeping. So: 
1. The screen is off (while it's on there is always some running app, e.g.Launcher) 
2. There is no running service (e.g. music, downloads) - no CPU locks.

AlarmManager wakes device from sleeping, runs what is to run. 
It's critical 
e.g. to ends a service that was created 
in broadcast receiver from alarm to let the device fall asleep again. 
If you do sth longer and important in the background 
you should acquire CPU lock for your app 
to prevent it from being killed by Android OS.

IMHO you shouldn't bother about sleep mode, 
just make your app "good Android citizen" by 
1）handling screen off and on intents (Intent.ACTION_SCREEN_OFF) if needed, 
2）finishing services ASAP, 
3）releasing resources (network, GPS, CPU) ASAP, 
4）using inexact alarms, 
5）download manager, 
and all good staff brought by OS. 
I believe that Android handles CPU sleeps transparently.
