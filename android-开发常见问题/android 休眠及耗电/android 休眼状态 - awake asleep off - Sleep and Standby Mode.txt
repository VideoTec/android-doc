There is not really a separate stage called "deep sleep". 
There is only "awake", "asleep", and "off".

Execution of all processes ceases 
when the device goes to sleep or is powered off.

cease[英][si:s] [美][sis]
vt.停止，终止，结束

休眼后，除了用户主动，重新打开，还有其它方法恢复吗？
If so, besides user hitting the power button, 
what else could wake the device back up?

1）An alarm from AlarmManager
2）An incoming phone call
3）An incoming text message
4）If you have a socket open on wireless data (not WiFi), 
   an incoming packet on that socket
怎么解释这个 (not WiFi) 见：

通讯协议栈运行于BP，一旦收到数据包，
BP会将AP唤醒，
唤醒的时间足够AP执行代码完成对收到的数据包的处理过程

The system only wakes up from that state upon device interrupts 
(e.g. incoming data from the network) or when a scheduled alarm fires.
