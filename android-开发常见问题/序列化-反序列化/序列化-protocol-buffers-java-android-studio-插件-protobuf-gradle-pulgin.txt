The Gradle plugin that compiles Protocol Buffer (aka. Protobuf) 
definition files (*.proto) in your project. There are two pieces of its job:

1) It assembles the Protobuf Compiler (protoc) command line and 
use it to generate Java source files out of your proto files.

2) It adds the generated Java source files 
to the input of the corresponding Java compilation unit
(sourceSet in a Java project; variant in an Android project), 
so that they can be compiled along with your Java sources.
