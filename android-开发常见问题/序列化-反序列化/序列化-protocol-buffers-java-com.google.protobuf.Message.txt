public interface Message
extends MessageLite, MessageOrBuilder
Abstract interface implemented by Protocol Message objects.

See also MessageLite, which defines most of the methods that typical users care about.
Message adds to it methods that are not available in the "lite" runtime. 
The biggest added features are introspection and reflection -- i.e., 
getting descriptors for the message type and accessing the field values dynamically.
