warning: cannot scan executable section 1 of jni/lib/libx264.a(pixel-a.o) for Cortex-A8 erratum because it has no mapping symbols.

原因可能是 libx264.a 编译问题？

This is apparently a known "issue" (behaviour) of the new linker that was introduced in R8C. See this bug report. 
These warnings can result from having stripped non-global symbols from the objects files that the linker needs to perform fixups.

That discussion yielded two suggested workarounds:

1) Remove all instances of strip -x in your makefile (if any exist).

2) Build with make STRIP=

Issue 40794:	NDK r8c warning for asm objects regarding "Cortex-A8 erratum"
With NDK r8c, linking of X264 encoder (on Mac OS, if that matters) issues warnings:

"cannot scan executable section 1 of libx264.a(dct-a.o) for Cortex-A8 erratum because it has no mapping symbols".

... same warning for all assembly files in libx264.

libx264.a itself was cross-compiled on the same Mac with the same 4.6 toolchain taken from NDK. Is it a problem with the new linker, or with the assembler that produced dct-a.o from dct-a.S, or with our configuration?

Sincerely,
Alex

产生问题的原因是：
The short answer is that (libx264的) Makefile wrongfully calling "strip" on *.o which removes essential mapping symbols ld.gold needs to fixup cortex-a8 erratum
