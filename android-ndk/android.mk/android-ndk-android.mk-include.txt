Including Other Makefiles

The include directive tells make to suspend reading the current makefile and read one or more other makefiles before continuing. The directive is a line in the makefile that looks like this:

include filenames…
filenames can contain shell file name patterns. If filenames is empty, nothing is included and no error is printed.
