LOCAL_CPPFLAGS  说明

An optional set of compiler flags that will be passed when building C++ source files only. 
They will appear after the LOCAL_CFLAGS on the compiler's command-line.

NOTE: In android-ndk-1.5_r1, the corresponding flags applied to both C and C++ sources. 
This has been corrected to match the full Android build system. 
(You can use LOCAL_CFLAGS to specify flags for both C and C++ sources now).
