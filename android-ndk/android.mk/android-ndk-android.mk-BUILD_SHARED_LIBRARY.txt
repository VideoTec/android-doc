BUILD_SHARED_LIBRARY

Points to a build script that collects all the information 
about the module you provided in LOCAL_XXX variables and 
determines how to build a target shared library from the sources you listed. 
Note that you must have LOCAL_MODULE and LOCAL_SRC_FILES defined, 
at a minimum before including this file. 
Example usage:

        include $(BUILD_SHARED_LIBRARY)

note that this will generate a file named lib.so.
