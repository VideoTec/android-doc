The following are GNU Make 'function' macros, and must be evaluated by using '$(call <function>)'. They return textual information

my-dir  返回上个include的 makefile 文件夹路径
Returns the path of the last included Makefile, 
which typically is the current Android.mk's directory. 

用于定义本地路径
This is useful to define LOCAL_PATH at the start of your Android.mk

LOCAL_PATH := $(call my-dir)

Do not call my-dir after including another file.
Due to the way GNU Make works, 
this really returns the path of the last included Makefile during the parsing of build scripts
