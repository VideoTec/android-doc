PREBUILT_SHARED_LIBRARY

Points to a build script used to specify a prebuilt shared library. 
Unlike BUILD_SHARED_LIBRARY and BUILD_STATIC_LIBRARY, 
the value of LOCAL_SRC_FILES must be 
a single path to a prebuilt shared library (e.g. foo/libfoo.so), 
instead of a source file.

You can reference the prebuilt library in another module 
using the LOCAL_PREBUILTS variable 
(see NDK Prebuilt Library Support for more information).
