import-module

A function that allows you to find and include the Android.mk of another module by name. A typical example is:

        $(call import-module,<name>)
And this will look for the module tagged <name> in the list of directories referenced by your NDK_MODULE_PATH environment variable, and include its Android.mk automatically for you.
