BUILD_STATIC_LIBRARY

A variant of BUILD_SHARED_LIBRARY that is used 
to build a target static library instead. 
Static libraries are not copied into your project/packages 
but can be used to build shared libraries 
(see LOCAL_STATIC_LIBRARIES and LOCAL_WHOLE_STATIC_LIBRARIES described below). 

Example usage:

        include $(BUILD_STATIC_LIBRARY)

Note that this will generate a file named lib.a.
