Prebuilt Libraries
Android NDK r5 introduced support for prebuilt libraries (shared and static), 
i.e. the ability to include and use, 
in your applications, prebuilt version of libraries.

This feature can be useful for two things:

1）You want to distribute your own libraries 
to third-party NDK developers without distributing your sources.
2）You want to use a prebuilt version of your own libraries to speed up your build.

This document explains how this support works.
