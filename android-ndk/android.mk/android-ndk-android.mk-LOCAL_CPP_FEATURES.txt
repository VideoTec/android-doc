LOCAL_CPP_FEATURES := rtti exceptions

LOCAL_CPP_FEATURES

This is an optional variable that can be defined to indicate that your code relies on specific C++ features. To indicate that your code uses RTTI (RunTime Type Information), use the following:

          LOCAL_CPP_FEATURES := rtti
To indicate that your code uses C++ exceptions, use:

          LOCAL_CPP_FEATURES := exceptions
You can also use both of them with (order is not important):

          LOCAL_CPP_FEATURES := rtti features
The effect of this variable is to enable the right compiler/linker flags when building your modules from sources. For prebuilt binaries, this also helps declare which features the binary relies on to ensure the final link works correctly.

It is recommended to use this variable instead of enabling -frtti and -fexceptions directly in your LOCAL_CPPFLAGS definition.
