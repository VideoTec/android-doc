代码：
LOCAL_LDLIBS    := -lavformat -lavcodec -lavresample -lswscale -lavutil -lx264 -lvo-aacenc -lopencore-amrnb -lopencore-amrwb -ljnigraphics -lz -llog

文档：
The list of additional linker flags to be used when building your shared library or executable. 
This is useful to pass the name of specific system libraries with the '-l' prefix. 
For example, the following will tell the linker to generate a module that links to /system/lib/libz.so at load time

LOCAL_LDLIBS := -lz

See Android NDK Stable APIs for the list of exposed system libraries you can linked against with this NDK release.

生成静态库的模块，会忽略这个变量 LOCAL_LDLIBS：
NOTE: This is ignored for static libraries, and ndk-build will print a warning if you define it in such a module.
