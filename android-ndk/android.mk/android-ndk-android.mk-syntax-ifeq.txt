构建时，条件判断

There is TARGET_ARCH variable that holds the value of the current ABI being built. You can use it the following way:

ifeq ($(TARGET_ARCH),x86)
    LOCAL_CFLAGS   := $(COMMON_FLAGS_LIST)
else
    LOCAL_CFLAGS   := -mfpu=vfp -mfloat-abi=softfp $(COMMON_FLAGS_LIST)
endif

If you specify APP_ABI := armeabi-v7a armeabi mips x86 or APP_ABI := all in your Application.mk you will get each and every separate ABI value.
