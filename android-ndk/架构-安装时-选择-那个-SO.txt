Note also that libs aren't mixed between CPU_ABI directories:
you need the full set of what you're using, 
a lib that is inside the armeabi folder 
will not be installed on a armeabi-v7a device 
if there are any libs inside the armeabi-v7a folder from the APK.

Seven distinct CPU-architectures are currently supported by the Android OS: 
ARMv5, ARMv7 (since 2010), 
x86 (2011), 
MIPS (2012), 
ARMv8, 
MIPS64 and x86_64 (2014). 
Each of them is associated with a respective ABI.
