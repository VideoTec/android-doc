libhoudini makes ARM-only NDK binaries usable on x86, 
giving x86-powered Android devices access to more of the Play Store catalog.

The good news is that SQLCipher for Android runs nicely on 
libhoudini-equipped x86 hardware, without the x86 binaries.

The bad news is that the test suite takes about three times as long.
