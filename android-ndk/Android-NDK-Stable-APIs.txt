This is the list of stable APIs/ABIs exposed by the Android NDK.

For example, 
to use system library "Foo", you would include a header like <foo.h> in your code, 
then tell the build system that your native module needs to link to /system/lib/libfoo.so at load-time by adding the following line to your Android.mk file:

LOCAL_LDLIBS := -lfoo

Note that the build system automatically links the C library, the Math library and the C++ support library to your native code, there is no need to list them in a LOCAL_LDLIBS line.

There are several "API Levels" defined. Each API level corresponds to a given Android system platform release. The following levels are currently supported:

  android-3      -> Official Android 1.5 system images
  The C Library                   automatically links your native modules to the C library
                                  the Android C library includes support for pthread (-lpthread)
                                  the Android C library includes support for real-time extensions (-lrt)
  The Math Library                the math library(-lm) is automatically linked to your native modules at build time
  C++ Library                     The C++ support library (-lstdc++) is automatically linked to your native modules

  Android-specific Log Support    LOCAL_LDLIBS := -llog
  ZLib Compression Library        LOCAL_LDLIBS := -lz
  Dynamic Linker Library          LOCAL_LDLIBS := -ldl
  
  android-4      -> Official Android 1.6 system images
  The OpenGL ES 1.x Library  LOCAL_LDLIBS := -lGLESv1_CM

  android-6      -> Official Android 2.0.1 system images
  android-7      -> Official Android 2.1 system images
  android-5      -> Official Android 2.0 system images
  The OpenGL ES 2.0 Library  LOCAL_LDLIBS := -lGLESv2

  android-8      -> Official Android 2.2 system images
  The 'jnigraphics' Library  LOCAL_LDLIBS += -ljnigraphics
  
  android-9      -> Official Android 2.3 system images
  The EGL graphics library             LOCAL_LDLIBS += -lEGL
  The OpenSL ES native audio Library   LOCAL_LDLIBS += -lOpenSLES
  The Android native application APIs  LOCAL_LDLIBS += -landroid
                                       Starting from API level 9, it is possible to entirely write an Android application with native code 
                                       (i.e. without any Java)
  
  android-14     -> Official Android 4.0 system images
  The OpenMAX AL native multimedia library  LOCAL_LDLIBS += -lOpenMAXAL
  The OpenSL ES native audio library
  
  android-18     -> Official Android 4.3 system images
  The OpenGL ES 3.0 Library  LOCAL_LDLIBS := -lGLESv3

Note that android-6 and android-7 are the same as android-5 for the NDK, i.e. they provide exactly the same native ABIs!
