Accessing Java Fields

The JNI provides functions that native methods use to get and set Java fields. 
You can get and set both instance fields and static (class) fields. 
Similar to accessing Java methods, 
you use different JNI functions to access instance and static fields.

Our example program, FieldAccess.java, 
contains a class with one static integer field si and an instance string field s. 
It calls the native method accessFields, 
which prints out the value of these two fields, 
and then sets the fields to new values. 
To verify the fields have indeed changed, 
we print out their values again in Java after returning from the native method.
