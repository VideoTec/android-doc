/**
 * The Color class defines methods for creating and converting color ints.
 * Colors are represented as packed ints, made up of 4 bytes: alpha, red,
 * green, blue. The values are unpremultiplied, meaning any transparency is
 * stored solely in the alpha component, and not in the color components. The
 * components are stored as follows (alpha << 24) | (red << 16) |
 * (green << 8) | blue. Each component ranges between 0..255 with 0
 * meaning no contribution for that component, and 255 meaning 100%
 * contribution. Thus opaque-black would be 0xFF000000 (100% opaque but
 * no contributions from red, green, or blue), and opaque-white would be
 * 0xFFFFFFFF
