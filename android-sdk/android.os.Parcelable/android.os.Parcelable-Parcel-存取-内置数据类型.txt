Primitives

The most basic data functions are 
for writing and reading primitive data types: 

writeByte(byte), readByte(), 
writeDouble(double), readDouble(), 
writeFloat(float), readFloat(), 
writeInt(int), readInt(), 
writeLong(long), readLong(),
writeString(String), readString(). 
 
Most other data operations are built on top of these. 
The given data is written and read using the endianess of the host CPU.
