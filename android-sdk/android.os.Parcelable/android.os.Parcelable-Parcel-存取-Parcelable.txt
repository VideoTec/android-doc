Parcelables

The Parcelable protocol provides an extremely efficient 
(but low-level) protocol for objects to write and read themselves from Parcels. 
You can use the direct methods 
writeParcelable(Parcelable, int) and readParcelable(ClassLoader) or 
writeParcelableArray(T[], int) and readParcelableArray(ClassLoader) to write or read. 

These methods write both the class type and its data to the Parcel, 
allowing that class to be reconstructed from the appropriate class loader when later reading.

There are also some methods that provide a more efficient way to work with Parcelables: 
writeTypedObject(T, int), writeTypedArray(T[], int), 
writeTypedList(List), readTypedObject(Parcelable.Creator), 
createTypedArray(Parcelable.Creator) and createTypedArrayList(Parcelable.Creator). 

These methods do not write the class information of the original object: 
instead, the caller of the read function must know what type to expect and 
pass in the appropriate Parcelable.Creator instead 
to properly construct the new object and read its data.
 
(To more efficient write and read a single Parceable object that is not null, 
you can directly call 
Parcelable.writeToParcel and 
Parcelable.Creator.createFromParcel yourself.)
