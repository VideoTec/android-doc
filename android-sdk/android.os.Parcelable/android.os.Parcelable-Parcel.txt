Container for a message (data and object references) 
that can be sent through an IBinder. 
A Parcel can contain both flattened data 
that will be unflattened on the other side of the IPC 
(using the various methods here for writing specific types, 
or the general Parcelable interface), 
and references to live IBinder objects 
that will result in the other side receiving 
a proxy IBinder connected with the original IBinder in the Parcel.

Parcel is not a general-purpose serialization mechanism. 
This class (and the corresponding Parcelable API for placing arbitrary objects into a Parcel) 
is designed as a high-performance IPC transport. 
As such, it is not appropriate to place any Parcel data in to persistent storage: 
changes in the underlying implementation of 
any of the data in the Parcel can render older data unreadable.

The bulk of the Parcel API revolves around 
reading and writing data of various types. 
There are six major classes of such functions available.
