android.os.Parcel

Container for a message (data and object references) 
that can be sent through an IBinder. 

A Parcel can contain both 

1）flattened data 
that will be unflattened on the other side of the IPC 
(using the various methods here for writing specific types, or the general Parcelable interface), and 

2）references to live IBinder objects 
that will result in the other side receiving a proxy IBinder connected with the original IBinder in the Parcel.
