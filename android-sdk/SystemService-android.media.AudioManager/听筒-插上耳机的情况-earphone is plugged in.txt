When I try to play a sound or Text-To-Speech sound through STREAM_RING and 
my earphone is plugged in, 
the sound will be played on both speakerphone and earphone. 

It seems to be a default behaviour for Android framework, 
but I'd like to have sounds play only on earphone when it plugged in.
