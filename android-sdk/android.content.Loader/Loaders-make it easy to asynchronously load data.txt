Introduced in Android 3.0, 
loaders make it easy to asynchronously load data in an activity or fragment. 
Loaders have these characteristics:

1）They are available to every Activity and Fragment.
2）They provide asynchronous loading of data.
   他们提供了异步加载数据的能力
3）They monitor the source of their data and deliver new results when the content changes.
   它们监视数据源的一举一动并在内容改变时传送新的结果
4）They automatically reconnect to the last loader's cursor when being recreated after a configuration change. Thus, they don't need to re-query their data.
   当由于配置改变而被重新创建后，它们自动重连到上一个加载器的游标，所以不必重新查询数据
