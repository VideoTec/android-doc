Abstract Loader that provides an AsyncTask to do the work.

提供一个AsyncTask来执行异步加载工作的抽象类。

Here is an example implementation of an AsyncTaskLoader subclass that 
loads the currently installed applications from the package manager. 
This implementation takes care of 
1）retrieving the application labels and 
2）sorting its result set from them, 
3）monitoring for changes to the installed applications, and 
4）rebuilding the list when a change in configuration requires this (such as a locale change).
