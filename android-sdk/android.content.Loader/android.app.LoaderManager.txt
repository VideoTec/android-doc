Class Overview

Interface associated with an Activity or Fragment 
for managing one or more Loader instances associated with it. 

This helps an application manage 
longer-running operations in conjunction with the Activity or Fragment lifecycle; 
the most common use of this is with a CursorLoader, 
however applications are free to write their own loaders for loading other types of data. 
While the LoaderManager API was introduced in HONEYCOMB, 
a version of the API at is also available for use on older platforms through FragmentActivity. 
See the blog post Fragments For All for more details.

As an example, here is the full implementation of a Fragment that 
displays a ListView containing the results of a query against the contacts content provider. 
It uses a CursorLoader to manage the query on the provider.

一个抽像类，关联到一个Activity或Fragment，管理一个或多个装载器的实例。
这帮助一个应用管理那些与Activity或Fragment的生命周期相关的长时间运行的的操作。
最常见的方式是与一个CursorLoader一起使用，
然而应用是可以随便写它们自己的装载器以加载其它类型的数据。
每个activity或fragment只有一个LoaderManager。
但是一个LoaderManager可以拥有多个装载器
