Scrolling

The framework provides basic support for views that wish to internally scroll their content. 
This includes keeping track of the X and Y scroll offset 
as well as mechanisms for drawing scrollbars. 

See 
scrollBy(int, int), 
scrollTo(int, int), and 
awakenScrollBars() for more details.

理解：view.java 中的成员：
protected int mScrollX;
protected int mScrollY;
private int mVerticalScrollbarPosition;
