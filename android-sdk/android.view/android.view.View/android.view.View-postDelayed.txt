public boolean postDelayed (Runnable action, long delayMillis)

Added in API level 1
Causes the Runnable to be added to the message queue, 
to be run after the specified amount of time elapses. 
The runnable will be run on the user interface thread.

Parameters
action	The Runnable that will be executed.
delayMillis	The delay (in milliseconds) until the Runnable will be executed.

Returns
true if the Runnable was successfully placed in to the message queue. 
Returns false on failure, usually because the looper processing the message queue is exiting. 
Note that a result of true does not mean the Runnable will be processed -- 
if the looper is quit before the delivery time of the message occurs then the message will be dropped.
