On some devices (Galaxy S2 etc.), there is a setting which can cause activities to be destroyed whilst debugging. You can find this in:

settings > developer options > go down to the bottom under apps section > 
Do not keep activities

Uncheck this option, to stop activities always being destroyed when you leave them.
