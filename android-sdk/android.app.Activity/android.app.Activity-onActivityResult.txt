protected void onActivityResult (int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data)

Added in API level 1
Called when an activity you launched exits, giving you the requestCode you started it with, the resultCode it returned, and any additional data from it. The resultCode will be RESULT_CANCELED if the activity explicitly returned that, didn't return any result, or crashed during its operation.

You will receive this call immediately before onResume() when your activity is re-starting.

This method is never invoked if your activity sets noHistory to true.

Parameters

requestCode
The integer request code originally supplied to startActivityForResult(), allowing you to identify who this result came from.

resultCode
The integer result code returned by the child activity through its setResult().

data
An Intent, which can return result data to the caller (various data can be attached to Intent "extras").
