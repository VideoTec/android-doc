http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9266417/difference-between-onpause-and-onstop

From android doc here http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html, 
it said 
'Activity comes into foreground' will call onPause(), and 
'Activity is no longer visible' will call onStop().

Isn't 
'Activity comes into foreground' same as 
'Activity is no longer visible'? 
Can you please tell me what is the difference between them?

No, if some activity comes into foreground, 
that doesn't necessarily mean that the other activity is completely invisible. 
（类似模态对话框的情况）
1）Floating
2）translucent[英][trænsˈlu:snt] [美][trænsˈlusənt, trænz-]
adj.半透明的；透亮的，有光泽的

That leaves a question 
which activity is considered fully opaque and covering the whole screen and which isn't. This decision is based on the window containing the activity. 
If the window has a flag windowIsFloating or windowIsTranslucent, 
then it is considered that the activity doesn't make the underlying stuff invisible, 
otherwise it does and will cause onStop() to be called. 
The relevant code can be found in com.android.server.am.ActivityRecord:

fullscreen = ent != null && !ent.array.getBoolean(
        com.android.internal.R.styleable.Window_windowIsFloating, false)
        && !ent.array.getBoolean(
        com.android.internal.R.styleable.Window_windowIsTranslucent, false);

onPause 
用于由一个Activity转到另一个Activity、
设备进入休眠状态(屏幕锁住了)、或者有dialog弹出时

onStop 
用于不可见的Activity
（有对话框弹出时，这时底下的activity仍然可见，所以此时onStop不会被调用）
