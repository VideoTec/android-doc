protected void onDestroy ()

Perform any final cleanup before an activity is destroyed. 
This can happen either because the activity is finishing (someone called finish() on it, 
or because the system is temporarily destroying this instance of the activity to save space.
You can distinguish between these two scenarios with the isFinishing() method.
