onCreate() is to onDestroy() && onStart() is to onStop() && onResume() is to onPause() .. 

onStart() is called when onCreate() finishes its work. 
if not its not called.. 

onResume() indicates the ui is about to be shown to the user -
(An Activity's content is the screen the user sees). 

if you call finish() in onCreate(), 
onPause() will be skipped because onResume() was never called same goes to onStart() .. 

so in some cases you can say its not; but that will be false, 
because what's an Activity that is not a screen or serve as a container for screens-(Fragment).

and why would you call finish(); directly in your Activity's onCreate()? 
From how Activities work in general, onPause() will always guarantee is calling..
