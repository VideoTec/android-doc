If you need root view of your activity (so you can add your contents there) use

findViewById(android.R.id.content)

please note that as Booger reported, 
this may be behind navigation bar (with back button etc.) on some devices 
(but it seems on most devices it is not).

If you need to get view that you 
added to your activity using setContentView() method then as pottedmeat wrote you can use

final ViewGroup viewGroup = (ViewGroup) ((ViewGroup) this
            .findViewById(android.R.id.content)).getChildAt(0);
            
But better just set id to this view in your xml layout and use this id instead.


This is what I use to get the root view as found in the XML file assigned with setContentView:

final ViewGroup viewGroup = (ViewGroup) ((ViewGroup) this
            .findViewById(android.R.id.content)).getChildAt(0);
            
This answer gave the view without the status bar - which is what I wanted. 
I was looking for the pixel width + height of the visible part of the activity. 
This one works, thanks!
