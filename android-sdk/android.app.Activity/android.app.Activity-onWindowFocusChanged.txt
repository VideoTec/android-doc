void	onWindowFocusChanged(boolean hasFocus)
Called when the current Window of the activity gains or loses focus.

Parameters
hasFocus	Whether the window of this activity has focus.

Called when the current Window of the activity gains or loses focus. 
This is the best indicator of whether this activity is visible to the user. 
The default implementation clears the key tracking state, so should always be called.

Note that this provides information about global focus state, 
which is managed independently of activity lifecycles. 
As such, while focus changes will generally have some relation to lifecycle changes 
(an activity that is stopped will not generally get window focus), 
you should not rely on any particular order between the callbacks here and those in the other lifecycle methods such as onResume().

As a general rule, however, a resumed activity will have window focus... 
unless it has displayed other dialogs or popups that take input focus, 
in which case the activity itself will not have focus when the other windows have it. 
Likewise, the system may display system-level windows (such as the status bar notification panel or a system alert) 
which will temporarily take window input focus without pausing the foreground activity.
