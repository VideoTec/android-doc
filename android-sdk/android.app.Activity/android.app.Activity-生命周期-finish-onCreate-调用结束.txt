I'm guessing that it is because finish() doesn't cause the onCreate method to return. 
You could try simply adding

finish();
return;

Or use an if else

@Override
public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
  super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
  setContentView(R.layout.layoutb);
  if(good data){
      //do stuff
  }else{
      finish();
  }
}

Try using the finish() method to close the Activity.
