public boolean onKeyDown (int keyCode, KeyEvent event)

Added in API level 1

Called when a key was pressed down and not handled by any of the views inside of the activity. So, for example, key presses while the cursor is inside a TextView will not trigger the event (unless it is a navigation to another object) because TextView handles its own key presses.

If the focused view didn't want this event, this method is called.

The default implementation takes care of KEYCODE_BACK by calling onBackPressed(), 
though the behavior varies based on the application compatibility mode:
 
1）for ECLAIR or later applications, 
it will set up the dispatch to call onKeyUp(int, KeyEvent) 
where the action will be performed; 

2）for earlier applications, 
it will perform the action immediately in on-down, as those versions of the platform behaved.

Other additional default key handling may be performed 
if configured with setDefaultKeyMode(int).

Parameters
keyCode	The value in event.getKeyCode().
event	Description of the key event.

Returns

propagate[英][ˈprɒpəgeɪt] [美][ˈprɑ:pəgeɪt]
vt.繁衍，增殖；使遗传；扩散；使蔓延

true to prevent this event from being propagated further, or 
false to indicate that you have not handled this event and it should continue to be propagated.
