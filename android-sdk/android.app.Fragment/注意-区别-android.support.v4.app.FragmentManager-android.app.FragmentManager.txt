A thing to be careful with: FragmentManager and LoaderManager have separate support versions for FragmentActivity:

If you are using a Fragment in an Activity (HoneyComb and up), call

getFragmentManager() to get android.app.FragmentManager
getLoaderManager() to get android.app.LoaderManager

if you are using a Fragment in a FragmentActivity (pre-HoneyComb), call:

getSupportFragmentManager() to get android.support.v4.app.FragmentManager.
getSupportLoaderManager() to get android.support.v4.app.LoaderManager
