attachToGLContext

Added in API level 16

void attachToGLContext (int texName)

Attach the SurfaceTexture to the OpenGL ES context 
that is current on the calling thread. 

A new OpenGL ES texture object is created and 
populated with the SurfaceTexture image frame 
that was current at the time of the last call to detachFromGLContext(). 
This new texture is bound to the GL_TEXTURE_EXTERNAL_OES texture target. 
This can be used to access the SurfaceTexture image contents from multiple OpenGL ES contexts.
 
Note, however, 
that the image contents are only accessible from one OpenGL ES context at a time.

Parameters

texName	int: 

The name of the OpenGL ES texture that will be created. 
This texture name must be unusued in the OpenGL ES context 
that is current on the calling thread.
