Builds a row of values using either of these approaches:

1）Values can be added with explicit column ordering using add(Object), 
which starts from the left-most column and adds one column value at a time. 
This follows the same ordering as the column names specified at cursor construction time.

2）Column and value pairs can be offered for possible inclusion using add(String, Object). 
If the cursor includes the given column, 
the value will be set for that column, 
otherwise the value is ignored. 
This approach is useful when matching data to a custom projection.

Undefined values are left as null.
