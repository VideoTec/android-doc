The main differences between the raw folder and the Assets folder.

1) Since raw is a subfolder of Resources (res), 
Android will automatically generate an ID for any file located inside it. 
This ID is then stored an the R class that will act as a reference to a file, 
meaning it can be easily accessed 
from other Android classes and methods and even in Android XML files. 
Using the automatically generated ID 
is the fastest way to have access to a file in Android.

2) The Assets folder is an “appendix” directory. 
The R class does not generate IDs for the files placed there, 
so its less compatible with some Android classes and methods. 
Also, it’s much slower to access a file inside it, 
since you will need to get a handle to it based on a String. 
However some operations are more easily done by placing files in this folder, 
like copying a database file to the system’s memory. 
There’s no (easy) way to create an Android XML reference to files inside the Assets folder.
