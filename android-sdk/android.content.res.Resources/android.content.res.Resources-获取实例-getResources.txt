The Android resource system 
keeps track of all non-code assets associated with an application. 
You can use this class to access your application's resources. 
You can generally acquire the Resources instance associated 
with your application with getResources().

public class ContextThemeWrapper extends ContextWrapper {

    @Override
    public Resources getResources() {
        if (mResources != null) {
            return mResources;
        }
        if (mOverrideConfiguration == null) {
            mResources = super.getResources();
            return mResources;
        } else {
            Context resc = createConfigurationContext(mOverrideConfiguration);
            mResources = resc.getResources();
            return mResources;
        }
    }
