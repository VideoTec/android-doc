Is this possible?
No. There is no blocking UI model in Android. Everything is asynchronous.

UPDATE

In response to some of your comments on the question itself, 
you cannot display a UI from a background thread. 
As I wrote in this answer, 
there is no blocking UI model in Android. 
Just put your code in the button handler for your dialog 
that you want to have executed when the dialog is accepted, 
such as in this sample project.
