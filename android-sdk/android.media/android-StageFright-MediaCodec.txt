Android 没有直接使用OpenMax IL层提供的纯C接口

在Android2.x版本之后：
Android的框架层也对OpenMax IL层的接口进行了封装定义，
使用Android中的Binder IPC机制

Android provides a media playback engine at the native level called Stagefright 

Stagefright
comes built-in with software-based codecs for several popular media formats. 

Stagefright features for 
audio and video playback include integration with OpenMAX codecs, 
session management, 
time-synchronized rendering, 
transport control, and DRM. 

Stagefright supports integration with custom hardware codecs that you provide. 
There actually isn't a HAL to implement for custom codecs, 
but to provide a hardware path to encode and decode media, 
you must implement your hardware-based codec as an OpenMax IL (Integration Layer) component.

整合自定义的编解码器到系统
he Stagefright service parses the 

system/etc/media_codecs.xml and 
system/etc/media_profiles.xml 

to expose the supported codecs and profiles on the device to app developers via the 
android.media.MediaCodecList and 
android.media.CamcorderProfile classes. 

You need to create both files in the 
device/<company_name>/<device_name>/ directory and 
copy this over to the system image's system/etc directory in your device's Makefile.
