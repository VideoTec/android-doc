AssetFileDescriptor afd = getAssets().openFd("AudioFile.mp3");
player = new MediaPlayer();

player.setDataSource(afd.getFileDescriptor(),afd.getStartOffset(),afd.getLength());

player.prepare();
player.start();

Your version would work if you had only one file in the assets directory. 
The asset directory contents are not actually 'real files' on disk. 
All of them are put together one after another. 
So, if you do not specify where to start and how many bytes to read, 
the player will read up to the end 
(that is, will keep playing all the files in assets directory)
