You can load the raw audio into an input stream and 
load it into a MediaPlayer as you would a normal stream:

InputStream ins = getResources().openRawResource(R.raw.example);

and then follow a streaming tutorial like pocketjourney
But this is overly complicated as you can just call

mp = MediaPlayer.create(counterstrikesb.this, R.raw.example);

代码：
        try {
            if (mMediaPlayer == null) {
                mMediaPlayer = MediaPlayer.create(this, R.raw.ringing);
            }
            mMediaPlayer.prepare();
            mMediaPlayer.start();
        } catch (Exception e) {
            Log.e(TAG, "media player play exception", e);
        }
		
异常：
media player play exception
  java.lang.IllegalStateException
      at android.media.MediaPlayer._prepare(Native Method)
	  
原因：
mp = MediaPlayer.create(...); is already preparing the MediaPlayer returned, 
so you cannot call prepare (or its variants) again 
(and there is no need for onPreparedListener as well).
