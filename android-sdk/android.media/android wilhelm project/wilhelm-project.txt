frameworks/wilhelm is the pathname of the git repository for 2 APIs:
 - Android native audio based on OpenSL ES
 - Android native media based on OpenMAX AL

OpenSL ES is recommended for lower-latency audio output. 低延迟
For audio input and normal latency audio output, 正常延迟
I recommend 建议使用下面的接口：
android.media.AudioRecord and 
android.media.AudioTrack 
respectively[美][rɪˈspɛktɪvli]各自的

Android native media APIs based on OpenMAX AL 1.0.1, and 
Android native audio APIs based on OpenSL ES 1.0.1, are both primarily API 
bindings only ... 
they don't directly interact with OpenMAX IL for the most part.  
Instead they do that through the 
Stagefright media framework and 
AudioFlinger for low-level audio. 
So if Stagefright and AudioFlinger are ported and working, then the native APIs should also work fine. 
There are a couple of exceptions[美][ɪkˈsɛpʃən]例外 where the native APIs access OpenMAX IL codecs, 
but even there they do it via a Stagefright wrapper. Those are: 
(1) enumerating supported video codecs, and 
(2) decoding audio to PCM.
