public AudioRecord (int audioSource, int sampleRateInHz, int channelConfig, int audioFormat, int bufferSizeInBytes)

bufferSizeInBytes
the total size (in bytes) of the buffer where audio data is written to during the recording. 
New audio data can be read from this buffer in smaller chunks than this size. 

See getMinBufferSize(int, int, int) to determine the minimum required buffer size for the successful creation of an AudioRecord instance. 
Using values smaller than getMinBufferSize() will result in an initialization failure.

另外的解释：
AudioRecord object initializes its associated audio buffer that it will fill with the new audio data. 
The size of this buffer, specified during the construction, 
determines how long an AudioRecord can record before "over-running" data that has not been read yet. 
Data should be read from the audio hardware in chunks of sizes inferior to the total recording buffer size.

bufferSizeInBytes该传入什么
