Upon creation, an AudioRecord object initializes 
its associated audio buffer that it will fill with the new audio data.
 
The size of this buffer, specified during the construction, 
determines how long an AudioRecord can record before "over-running" data that has not been read yet. 
Data should be read from the audio hardware in chunks of sizes inferior to the total recording buffer size.
