Logging Trace Files

Debug can create log files that give details about an application, 
such as a call stack and start/stop times for any running methods. 
See Traceview: 
A Graphical Log Viewer for information about reading trace files. 
To start logging trace files, call one of the startMethodTracing() methods. 
To stop tracing, call stopMethodTracing().
