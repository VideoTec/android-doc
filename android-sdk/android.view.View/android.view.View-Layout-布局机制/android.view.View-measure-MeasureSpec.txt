Class Overview

A MeasureSpec encapsulates the layout requirements passed from parent to child. Each MeasureSpec represents a requirement for either the width or the height. A MeasureSpec is comprised of a size and a mode. There are three possible modes:

UNSPECIFIED 0 (0x00000000)
The parent has not imposed any constraint on the child. It can be whatever size it wants.

EXACTLY 1073741824 (0x40000000)
The parent has determined an exact size for the child. The child is going to be given those bounds regardless of how big it wants to be.

AT_MOST -2147483648 (0x80000000)
The child can be as large as it wants up to the specified size.

MeasureSpecs are implemented as ints to reduce object allocation. This class is provided to pack and unpack the <size, mode> tuple into the int.
