A View is added over your activity/fragment/Dialog etc. 
Therefore it doesn't have its own onDestroy alike event. 
So instead, 
use activity's/fragment's onDestroy method to identify when the View is not valid anymore.

You can remove a View from a ViewGroup, 
but there is no way to manually destroy a view.
