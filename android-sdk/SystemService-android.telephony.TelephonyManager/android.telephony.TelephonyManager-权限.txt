public static final String ACTION_PHONE_STATE_CHANGED
------------------------------------------------------------------

Added in API level 3
Broadcast intent action indicating that the call state on the device has changed.

The EXTRA_STATE extra indicates the new call state. 
If the new state is RINGING, 
a second extra EXTRA_INCOMING_NUMBER provides the incoming phone number as a String.

Requires the READ_PHONE_STATE permission.

This was a sticky broadcast in version 1.0, 
but it is no longer sticky. 
Instead, use getCallState() to synchronously query the current call state.
