一个 public 接口
public interface TimeInterpolator

A time interpolator defines the rate of change of an animation. 
This allows animations to have non-linear motion, such as acceleration and deceleration.

唯一的成员函数
public abstract float getInterpolation (float input)

Added in API level 1
Maps 
a value representing the elapsed fraction of an animation to 
a value that represents the interpolated fraction. 
This interpolated value is then multiplied by the change in value of an animation 
to derive the animated value at the current elapsed animation time.

Parameters
input A value between 0 and 1.0 indicating our current point in the animation where 
0 represents the start and 1.0 represents the end

Returns
The interpolation value. This value can be 
more than 1.0 for interpolators which overshoot their targets, or 
less than 0 for interpolators that undershoot their targets.
