loadUrl

Added in API level 8
void loadUrl (String url, 
                Map<String, String> additionalHttpHeaders)
                
Loads the given URL with the specified additional HTTP headers.

Also see compatibility note on evaluateJavascript(String, ValueCallback).

Parameters

url
String: the URL of the resource to load

additionalHttpHeadersMap: 
the additional headers to be used in the HTTP request for this URL, 
specified as a map from name to value. 
Note that if this map contains any of the headers that are set by default by this WebView, 
such as those controlling caching, accept types or the User-Agent, 
their values may be overriden by this WebView's defaults.

Try

loadUrl(String url, Map<String, String> extraHeaders)

Unfortunately this only works on API8+.
