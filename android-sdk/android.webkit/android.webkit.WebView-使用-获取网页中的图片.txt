In short: no. 
There's no API to access the downloaded resources from the WebView from Java. 
You'll need to roll your own solution.

In the case of images, 
the only way I can think of 
to avoid re-downloading the resource would be to write some javascript 
that copied the image once it was loaded into a <canvas> element 
and then read the bytes back as a data URL. 
You'd then be able to recreate the image 
on the Java side from that data URL 
(by passing it to Java via a JavaScript interface in your WebView) 
and save it to disk or work with it otherwise.
