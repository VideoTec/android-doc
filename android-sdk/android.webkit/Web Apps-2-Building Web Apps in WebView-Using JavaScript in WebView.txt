Using JavaScript in WebView

If the web page you plan to load in your WebView use JavaScript, 
you must enable JavaScript for your WebView. 

Once JavaScript is enabled, 
you can also create interfaces between your application code and your JavaScript code.

Enabling JavaScript
------------------------------------------------

JavaScript is disabled in a WebView by default. 
You can enable it through the WebSettings attached to your WebView. 
You can retrieve WebSettings with getSettings(), 
then enable JavaScript with setJavaScriptEnabled().

For example:

WebView myWebView = (WebView) findViewById(R.id.webview);
WebSettings webSettings = myWebView.getSettings();
webSettings.setJavaScriptEnabled(true);

WebSettings provides access to a variety of other settings 
that you might find useful. 

For example, 
if you're developing a web application 
that's designed specifically for the WebView in your Android application, 
then you can define a custom user agent string with setUserAgentString(), 
then query the custom user agent in your web page 
to verify that the client requesting your web page is actually your Android application
