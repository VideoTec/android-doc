    /**
     * Notify the host application to handle a SSL client certificate
     * request. The host application is responsible for showing the UI
     * if desired and providing the keys. There are three ways to
     * respond: proceed(), cancel() or ignore(). Webview remembers the
     * response if proceed() or cancel() is called and does not
     * call onReceivedClientCertRequest() again for the same host and port
     * pair. Webview does not remember the response if ignore() is called.
     *
     * This method is called on the UI thread. During the callback, the
     * connection is suspended.
     *
     * The default behavior is to cancel, returning no client certificate.
     *
     * @param view The WebView that is initiating the callback
     * @param request An instance of a {@link ClientCertRequest}
     *
