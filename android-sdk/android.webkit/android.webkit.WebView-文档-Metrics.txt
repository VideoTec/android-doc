Metrics

WebView may upload anonymous diagnostic data to Google when the user has consented. 
This data helps Google improve WebView. 
Data is collected on a per-app basis for each app which has instantiated a WebView. 
An individual app can opt out of this feature by putting the following tag in its manifest:

 <meta-data android:name="android.webkit.WebView.MetricsOptOut"
            android:value="true" />
 
Data will only be uploaded for a given app 
if the user has consented AND the app has not opted out.
