setBuiltInZoomControls

Added in API level 3

void setBuiltInZoomControls (boolean enabled)
Sets whether the WebView should use its built-in zoom mechanisms. 
The built-in zoom mechanisms comprise on-screen zoom controls, 
which are displayed over the WebView's content, 
and the use of a pinch gesture to control zooming. 
Whether or not these on-screen controls are displayed can be set with setDisplayZoomControls(boolean). 
The default is false.

The built-in mechanisms are the only currently supported zoom mechanisms, 
so it is recommended that this setting is always enabled.

Parameters
enabled	boolean: whether the WebView should use its built-in zoom mechanisms
