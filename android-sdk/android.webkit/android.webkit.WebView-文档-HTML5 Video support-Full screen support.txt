Full screen support

In order to support full screen — for video or other HTML content — 
you need to set a WebChromeClient and 
implement both 
onShowCustomView(View, WebChromeClient.CustomViewCallback) and 
onHideCustomView(). 
If the implementation of either of these two methods is missing 
then the web contents will not be allowed to enter full screen. 

Optionally you can implement 
getVideoLoadingProgressView() 
to customize the View displayed whilst a video is loading.
