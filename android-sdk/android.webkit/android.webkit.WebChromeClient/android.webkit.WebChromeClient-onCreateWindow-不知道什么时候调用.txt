     * Request the host application to create a new window. If the host
     * application chooses to honor this request, it should return true from
     * this method, create a new WebView to host the window, insert it into the
     * View system and send the supplied resultMsg message to its target with
     * the new WebView as an argument. If the host application chooses not to
     * honor the request, it should return false from this method. The default
     * implementation of this method does nothing and hence returns false.
     * @param view The WebView from which the request for a new window
     *             originated.
     * @param isDialog True if the new window should be a dialog, rather than
     *                 a full-size window.
     * @param isUserGesture True if the request was initiated by a user gesture,
     *                      such as the user clicking a link.
     * @param resultMsg The message to send when once a new WebView has been
     *                  created. resultMsg.obj is a
     *                  {@link WebView.WebViewTransport} object. This should be
     *                  used to transport the new WebView, by calling
     *                  {@link WebView.WebViewTransport#setWebView(WebView)
     *                  WebView.WebViewTransport.setWebView(WebView)}.
     * @return This method should return true if the host application will
     *         create a new window, in which case resultMsg should be sent to
     *         its target. Otherwise, this method should return false. Returning
     *         false from this method but also sending resultMsg will result in
     *         undefined behavior.
