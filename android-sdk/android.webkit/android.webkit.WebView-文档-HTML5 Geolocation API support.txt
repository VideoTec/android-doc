HTML5 Geolocation API support

For applications targeting Android N and later releases (API level > M) 
the geolocation api is only supported on secure origins such as https. 

For such applications requests to geolocation api on non-secure origins 
are automatically denied without 
invoking the corresponding 
onGeolocationPermissionsShowPrompt(String, GeolocationPermissions.Callback) 
method.
