Layout size

It is recommended to set the WebView layout height 
to a fixed value or to MATCH_PARENT instead of using WRAP_CONTENT. 

When using MATCH_PARENT for the height none of the WebView's parents 
should use a WRAP_CONTENT layout height since 
that could result in incorrect sizing of the views.

Setting the WebView's height to WRAP_CONTENT enables the following behaviors:

The HTML body layout height is set to a fixed value. 
This means that elements with a height relative to the HTML body may not be sized correctly.

For applications targetting KITKAT and earlier SDKs 
the HTML viewport meta tag will be ignored 
in order to preserve backwards compatibility.

Using a layout width of WRAP_CONTENT is not supported. 
If such a width is used 
the WebView will attempt to use the width of the parent instead.
