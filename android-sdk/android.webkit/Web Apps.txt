There are essentially two ways to deliver an application on Android: 

1）as a client-side application 
(developed using the Android SDK and installed on user devices in an APK) or 

2）as a web application 
(developed using web standards and accessed 
through a web browser—there's nothing to install on user devices).

If you chose to provide a web-based app for Android-powered devices, 
you can rest assured that major web browsers for Android (and the WebView framework) 
allow you to specify viewport and style properties 
that make your web pages appear at the proper size and 
scale on all screen configurations.

Figure 1 illustrates 
how you can provide access to your web pages 
from either a web browser or your your own Android app. 
However, you shouldn't develop an Android app simply as a means to view your web site. 
Rather, the web pages you embed in your Android app 
should be designed especially for that environment. 
You can even define an interface 
between your Android application and your web pages 
that allows JavaScript in the web pages to call upon APIs 
in your Android application—providing Android APIs to your web-based application.
