If your app uses WebView...
Your app might behave differently when running on Android 4.4, 
especially when you update your app's targetSdkVersion to "19" or higher.

The code underlying the WebView class and related APIs 
has been upgraded to be based on a modern snapshot of the Chromium source code. 
This brings a variety of improvements for performance, 
support for new HTML5 features, and support for remote debugging of your WebView content. 
The scope of this upgrade means that if your app uses WebView, 
its behavior may be impacted in some cases. 
Although known behavior changes are documented and mostly affect your app only 
when you update your app's targetSdkVersion to "19" 
or higher—the new WebView operates in "quirks mode" 
to provide some legacy functionality in apps that target API level 18 
and lower—it's possible that your app depends on unknown behaviors from the previous version of WebView.

So if your existing app uses WebView, 
it's important that you test on Android 4.4 as soon as possible and 
consult Migrating to WebView in Android 4.4 for information about 
how your app might be affected when you update your targetSdkVersion to "19" or higher

Android 4.4 Kitkat版本中，
原本基于Android WebKit的WebView实现被换成基于Chromium的WebView实现

新的Chromium实现专注于提供一致性的接口（为了兼容以前的应用），
而内部的渲染引擎改为使用基于Blink/Content内核的引擎

If the device is running in Android 4.4, then you may need to do something different to get the value back.

Try like this :

string script = "javascript:GoBack();";
            if(Android.OS.Build.VERSION.SdkInt >= Android.OS.BuildVersionCodes.Kitkat) {
                mWebView.EvaluateJavascript(script, null);
            } else {
                mWebView.LoadUrl(script);
            }
