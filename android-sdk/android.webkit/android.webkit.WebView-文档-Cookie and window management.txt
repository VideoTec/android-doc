Cookie and window management

For obvious security reasons, 
your application has its own cache, 
cookie store etc.â€”it does not share the Browser application's data.

By default, 
requests by the HTML to open new windows are ignored. 
This is true whether they be opened by JavaScript or by the target attribute on a link. 
You can customize your WebChromeClient to provide your own behaviour for opening multiple windows, 
and render them in whatever manner you want.

The standard behavior for an Activity is to be destroyed and recreated 
when the device orientation or any other configuration changes. 
This will cause the WebView to reload the current page. 

If you don't want that,
you can set your Activity to handle the orientation and keyboardHidden changes, 
and then just leave the WebView alone. 
It'll automatically re-orient itself as appropriate. 
Read Handling Runtime Changes for more information about 
how to handle configuration changes during runtime.
