java.lang.Object
   â†³	android.webkit.WebSettings
   
Manages settings state for a WebView. 
When a WebView is first created, it obtains a set of default settings. 
These default settings will be returned from any getter call.

A WebSettings object obtained from WebView.getSettings() 
is tied to the life of the WebView.
 
If a WebView has been destroyed, 
any method call on WebSettings will throw an IllegalStateException.
