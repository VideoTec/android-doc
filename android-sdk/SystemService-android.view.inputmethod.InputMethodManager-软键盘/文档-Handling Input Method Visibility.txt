When input focus moves into or out of an editable text field, 
Android shows or hides the input method (such as the on-screen keyboard) as appropriate. 
The system also makes decisions about how your UI and the text field appear above the input method. 

For example, 
when the vertical space on the screen is constrained, 
the text field might fill all space above the input method. 

For most apps, 
these default behaviors are all that's needed.

In some cases, though, 
you might want to more directly control the visibility of the input method and 
specify how you'd like your layout to appear when the input method is visible. 
This lesson explains how to control and respond to the input method visibility.
