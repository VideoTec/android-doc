软键盘的显示原理

软键盘其实是一个Dialog。
InputMethodService为我们的输入法创建了一个Dialog，
并且对某些参数进行了设置，使之能够在底部或者全屏显示。

当我们点击输入框时，
系统会对当前的主窗口进行调整，
以便留出相应的空间来显示该Dialog在底部，或者全屏

Specify How Your UI Should Respond
When the input method appears on the screen, 
it reduces the amount of space available for your app's UI. 
The system makes a decision as to how it should adjust the visible portion of your UI, 
but it might not get it right. 
To ensure the best behavior for your app, 
you should specify how you'd like the system to display your UI in the remaining space.

To declare your preferred treatment in an activity, 
use the android:windowSoftInputMode attribute in your manifest's <activity> element with one of the "adjust" values.

For example, 
to ensure that the system resizes your layout 
to the available space—which ensures that all of your layout content is accessible 
(even though it probably requires scrolling) — use "adjustResize":

<application ... >
    <activity
        android:windowSoftInputMode="adjustResize" ... >
        ...
    </activity>
    ...
</application>

You can combine the adjustment specification with the initial input method visibility specification from above:

    <activity
        android:windowSoftInputMode="stateVisible|adjustResize" ... >
        ...
    </activity>
	
Specifying "adjustResize" is important if your UI includes controls 
that the user might need to access immediately after or while performing text input. 

For example, 
if you use a relative layout to place a button bar at the bottom of the screen, 
using "adjustResize" resizes the layout so the button bar appears above the input method.
