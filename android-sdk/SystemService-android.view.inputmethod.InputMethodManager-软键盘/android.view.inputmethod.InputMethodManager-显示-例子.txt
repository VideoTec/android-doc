Show the Input Method On Demand
If there is a method in your activity's lifecycle where you want to ensure that the input method is visible, 
you can use the InputMethodManager to show it.

For example, the following method takes a View in which the user should type something, 
calls requestFocus() to give it focus, then showSoftInput() to open the input method:

public void showSoftKeyboard(View view) {
    if (view.requestFocus()) {
        InputMethodManager imm = (InputMethodManager)
                getSystemService(Context.INPUT_METHOD_SERVICE);
        imm.showSoftInput(view, InputMethodManager.SHOW_IMPLICIT);
    }
}

Note: Once the input method is visible, you should not programmatically hide it. 
The system hides the input method when the user finishes the task in the text field or 
the user can hide it with a system control (such as with the Back button).
