Positioning your Toast

A standard toast notification appears near the bottom of 
the screen, centered horizontally. 
You can change this position with the  setGravity(int, int, int) method.
This accepts three parameters: 
a  Gravity constant, an x-position offset, and a y-position offset.

For example, if you decide that the toast should appear in the top-left corner, 
you can set the gravity like this:

toast.setGravity(Gravity.TOP|Gravity.LEFT, 0, 0);

If you want to nudge the position to the right, 
increase the value of the second parameter. 
To nudge it down, increase the value of the last parameter.
