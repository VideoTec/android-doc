java.lang.Object
   ↳	android.app.LoaderManager

Interface associated with an Activity or Fragment for managing one or more Loader instances associated with it.
每个Activity和Fragment中，都会有且只有一个LoaderManager，而LoaderManager中可以有多个Loader

This helps an application manage longer-running operations in conjunction with the Activity or Fragment lifecycle; the most common use of this is with a CursorLoader, however applications are free to write their own loaders for loading other types of data. While the LoaderManager API was introduced in HONEYCOMB, a version of the API at is also available for use on older platforms through FragmentActivity. See the blog post Fragments For All for more details.

As an example, here is the full implementation of a Fragment that displays a ListView containing the results of a query against the contacts content provider. It uses a CursorLoader to manage the query on the provider.

在Android3.0中，Google引入了一种数据异步加载机制，
该机制的核心，便是LoaderManager、Loader，
顾名思义，LoaderManager是Loader的管理者，而Loader便是数据加载器，
你可以根据自己的需要实现形形色色的数据加载器
