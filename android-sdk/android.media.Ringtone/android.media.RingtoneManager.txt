android.media.RingtoneManager

RingtoneManager provides access to ringtones, notification, and other types of sounds. 
It manages querying the different media providers and combines the results into a single cursor. 
It also provides a Ringtone for each ringtone.
 
We generically call these sounds ringtones, 
however the TYPE_RINGTONE refers to the type of sounds that are suitable for the phone ringer.

To show a ringtone picker to the user, 
use the ACTION_RINGTONE_PICKER intent to launch the picker as a subactivity.
