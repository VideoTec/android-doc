http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10723770/whats-the-best-way-to-iterate-an-android-cursor

The simplest way is this:

while (cursor.moveToNext()) {
    ...
    问题，这样写，会不会把每一项给忽略了？
}

The cursor starts before the first result row, 
so on the first iteration this moves to the first result if it exists. 
If the cursor is empty, or the last row has already been processed, 
then the loop exits neatly.

Of course, don't forget to close the cursor once you're done with it, preferably in a finally clause.

Cursor cursor = db.rawQuery(...);
try {
    while (cursor.moveToNext()) {
        ...
    }
} finally {
    cursor.close();
}

If you target API 19+, you can use try-with-resources.

try (Cursor cursor = db.rawQuery(...)) {
    while (cursor.moveToNext()) {
        ...
    }
}
