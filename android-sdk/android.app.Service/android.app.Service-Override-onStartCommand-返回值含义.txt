For started services, there are two additional major modes of operation they can decide to run in, depending on the value they return from onStartCommand(): 
1）START_STICKY is used for services that are explicitly started and stopped as needed, while 
2）START_NOT_STICKY or 
3）START_REDELIVER_INTENT are used for services that should only remain running while processing any commands sent to them. 

See the linked documentation for more detail on the semantics.
