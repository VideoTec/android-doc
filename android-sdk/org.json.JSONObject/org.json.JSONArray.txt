https://developer.android.com/reference/org/json/JSONArray.html?hl=zh-cn

A dense indexed sequence of values. 
Values may be any mix of 
JSONObjects, other 
JSONArrays, 
Strings, Booleans, Integers, Longs, Doubles, null or NULL. 

Values may not be 
NaNs, infinities, or of any type not listed here.

JSONArray has the same type coercion behavior 
and optional/mandatory accessors as JSONObject. 
See that class' documentation for details.

Warning: this class represents null in two incompatible ways: 
the standard Java null reference, and the sentinel value NULL. 
In particular, get fails if the requested index holds the null reference, 
but succeeds if it holds JSONObject.NULL.

Instances of this class are not thread safe. 
Although this class is nonfinal, 
it was not designed for inheritance and should not be subclassed. 
In particular, self-use by overridable methods is not specified. 
See Effective Java Item 17, 
"Design and Document or inheritance or else prohibit it" for further information.
