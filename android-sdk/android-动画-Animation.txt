View Animation
You can use the view animation system to perform tweened animation on Views. 
Tween animation calculates the animation with information 
such as the start point, end point, size, rotation, 
and other common aspects of an animation.

android.view.animation

Provides classes that handle tweened animations.

Android provides two mechanisms that you can use to create simple animations: 

1) tweened animation, 
in which you tell Android to perform a series of simple transformations 
(position, size, rotation, and so on) to the content of a View; and 

2)frame-by-frame animation, 
which loads a series of Drawable resources one after the other. 
Both animation types can be used in any View object to provide simple rotating timers, 
activity icons, and other useful UI elements. 
Tweened animation is handled by this package (android.view.animation); 
frame-by-frame animation is handled by the AnimationDrawable class.

For more information on creating tweened or frame-by-frame animations, read the discussion in the 2D Graphics Dev Guide.
