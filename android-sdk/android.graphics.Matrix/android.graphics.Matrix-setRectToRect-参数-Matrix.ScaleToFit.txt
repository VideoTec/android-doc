Controlls how the src rect should align into the dst rect for setRectToRect().

CENTER

Added in API level 1
Matrix.ScaleToFit CENTER
Compute a scale that will maintain the original src aspect ratio, 
but will also ensure that src fits entirely inside dst. 
At least one axis (X or Y) will fit exactly. The result is centered inside dst.

END

Added in API level 1
Matrix.ScaleToFit END
Compute a scale that will maintain the original src aspect ratio, 
but will also ensure that src fits entirely inside dst. 
At least one axis (X or Y) will fit exactly. 
END aligns the result to the right and bottom edges of dst.

FILL

Added in API level 1
Matrix.ScaleToFit FILL
Scale in X and Y independently, so that src matches dst exactly. 
This may change the aspect ratio of the src.

START

Added in API level 1
Matrix.ScaleToFit START
Compute a scale that will maintain the original src aspect ratio, 
but will also ensure that src fits entirely inside dst. 
At least one axis (X or Y) will fit exactly. 
START aligns the result to the left and top edges of dst.
