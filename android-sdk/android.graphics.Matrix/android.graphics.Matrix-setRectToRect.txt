Matrix.ScaleToFit 有四个值

Matrix.ScaleToFit 	CENTER
Compute a scale that will maintain the original src aspect ratio, 
but will also ensure that src fits entirely inside dst. 

Matrix.ScaleToFit 	END
Compute a scale that will maintain the original src aspect ratio, 
but will also ensure that src fits entirely inside dst.

Matrix.ScaleToFit 	FILL
Scale in X and Y independently, so that src matches dst exactly. 

Matrix.ScaleToFit 	START
Compute a scale that will maintain the original src aspect ratio, 
but will also ensure that src fits entirely inside dst.
