public boolean setRectToRect(RectF src, RectF dst, ScaleToFit stf)

可以使用整数来构建 RectF
int width, int height
RectF viewRect = new RectF(0, 0, width, height);

/**
 * RectF holds four float coordinates for a rectangle. The rectangle is
 * represented by the coordinates of its 4 edges (left, top, right bottom).
 * These fields can be accessed directly. Use width() and height() to retrieve
 * the rectangle's width and height. Note: most methods do not check to see that
 * the coordinates are sorted correctly (i.e. left <= right and top <= bottom).
