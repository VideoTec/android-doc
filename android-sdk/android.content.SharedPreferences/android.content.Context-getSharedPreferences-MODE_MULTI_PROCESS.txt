This constant was deprecated in API level 23.
MODE_MULTI_PROCESS 
does not work reliably in some versions of Android, and furthermore 
does not provide any mechanism for reconciling concurrent modifications across processes. 
Applications should not attempt to use it. 
Instead, they should use an explicit cross-process data management approach 
such as ContentProvider.

SharedPreference loading flag: 
when set, the file on disk will be checked for modification 
even if the shared preferences instance is already loaded in this process. 
This behavior is sometimes desired in cases where the application has multiple processes, 
all writing to the same SharedPreferences file. 
Generally there are better forms of communication between processes, though.

This was the legacy (but undocumented) behavior in and before Gingerbread (Android 2.3) and 
this flag is implied when targetting such releases. 
For applications targetting SDK versions greater than Android 2.3, 
this flag must be explicitly set if desired.
