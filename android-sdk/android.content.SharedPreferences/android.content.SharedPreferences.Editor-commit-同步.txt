public abstract boolean commit ()

Added in API level 1

Commit your preferences changes back from this Editor to the SharedPreferences object it is editing. This atomically performs the requested modifications, replacing whatever is currently in the SharedPreferences.

Note that when two editors are modifying preferences at the same time, the last one to call commit wins.

If you don't care about the return value and you're using this from your application's main thread, consider using apply() instead.

Returns
Returns true if the new values were successfully written to persistent storage.
