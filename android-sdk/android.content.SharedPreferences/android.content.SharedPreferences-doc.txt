Class Overview

Interface for accessing and modifying preference data returned by 
getSharedPreferences(String, int). 

For any particular set of preferences, 
there is a single instance of this class that all clients share. 

Modifications to the preferences must go through an SharedPreferences.Editor object to ensure the preference values remain in a consistent state and control when they are committed to storage. Objects that are returned from the various get methods must be treated as immutable by the application.

Note: 
currently this class does not support use across multiple processes. 
This will be added later.
