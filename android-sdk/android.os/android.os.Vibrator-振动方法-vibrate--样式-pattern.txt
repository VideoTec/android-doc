public void vibrate (long[] pattern, int repeat, AudioAttributes attributes)
-----------------------------------------------------------

Added in API level 21
Vibrate with a given pattern.

Pass in an array of ints that are the durations for which to turn on or off the vibrator in milliseconds. The first value indicates the number of milliseconds to wait before turning the vibrator on. The next value indicates the number of milliseconds for which to keep the vibrator on before turning it off. Subsequent values alternate between durations in milliseconds to turn the vibrator off or to turn the vibrator on.

To cause the pattern to repeat, pass the index into the pattern array at which to start the repeat, or -1 to disable repeating.

This method requires the caller to hold the permission VIBRATE.

Parameters
pattern	an array of longs of times for which to turn the vibrator on or off.
repeat	the index into pattern at which to repeat, or -1 if you don't want to repeat.
attributes	AudioAttributes corresponding to the vibration. For example, specify USAGE_ALARM for alarm vibrations or USAGE_NOTIFICATION_RINGTONE for vibrations associated with incoming calls.
