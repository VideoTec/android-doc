第一点，理解 Handler 的构造函数
public Handler ()
Default constructor associates this handler with the Looper for the current thread. 
If this thread does not have a looper, this handler won't be able to receive messages so an exception is thrown.

说明每个线程，都可以有一个，Looper

第二点，Looper 文档
Class used to run a message loop for a thread. 
Threads by default do not have a message loop associated with them; 
to create one, 
call prepare() in the thread that is to run the loop, and 
then loop() to have it process messages until the loop is stopped.

  class LooperThread extends Thread {
      public Handler mHandler;

      public void run() {
          Looper.prepare();

          mHandler = new Handler() {  Handler 默认构造函数 associates this handler with the Looper for the current thread
              public void handleMessage(Message msg) {
                  // process incoming messages here
              }
          };

          Looper.loop();
      }
  }
