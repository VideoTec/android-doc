hierarchy[英][ˈhaɪərɑ:ki] [美][ˈhaɪərɑ:rki]
n.[计]分层，层次；等级制度；统治集团；天使的级别或等

Set the screen content to an explicit view. This view is placed directly into the screen's view hierarchy. It can itself be a complex view hierarchy.

Note that calling this function "locks in" various characteristics of the window that can not, from this point forward, be changed: the features that have been requested with requestFeature(int), and certain window flags as described in setFlags(int, int).

If FEATURE_CONTENT_TRANSITIONS is set, the window's TransitionManager will be used to animate content from the current content View to view.

Parameters

view	The desired content to display.
params	Layout parameters for the view.
