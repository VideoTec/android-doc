java.lang.Object
   ↳	android.view.Window

Abstract base class for a top-level window look and behavior policy. An instance of this class should be used as the top-level view added to the window manager. 
It provides standard UI policies such as a background, title area, default key processing, etc.

The only existing implementation of this abstract class is android.policy.PhoneWindow, which you should instantiate when needing a Window. 
Eventually that class will be refactored（重构） and a factory method added for creating Window instances without knowing about a particular implementation.
