public static interface
SurfaceHolder.Callback

android.view.SurfaceHolder.Callback

Known Indirect Subclasses
GLSurfaceView, NativeActivity, SurfaceHolder.Callback2

Class Overview

A client may implement this interface to receive information about changes to the surface. When used with a SurfaceView, the Surface being held is only available between calls to surfaceCreated(SurfaceHolder) and surfaceDestroyed(SurfaceHolder). The Callback is set with SurfaceHolder.addCallback method.


public class RecordView extends Activity 
                        implements android.view.SurfaceHolder.Callback {

SurfaceHolder是一个接口，其作用就像一个关于Surface的监听器。提供访问和控制SurfaceView背后的Surface 相关的方法 
它通过三个回调方法，让我们可以感知到Surface的创建、销毁或者改变
在SurfaceView中有一个方法getHolder，可以很方便地获得SurfaceView所对应的Surface所对应的SurfaceHolder

-------------------------
三个方法：
-------------------------
abstract void	surfaceChanged(SurfaceHolder holder, int format, int width, int height)
This is called immediately after any structural changes (format or size) have been made to the surface.

abstract void	surfaceCreated(SurfaceHolder holder)
This is called immediately after the surface is first created.

abstract void	surfaceDestroyed(SurfaceHolder holder)
This is called immediately before a surface is being destroyed.
