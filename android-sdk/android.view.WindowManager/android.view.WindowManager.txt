Class Overview
The interface that apps use to talk to the window manager.

Use Context.getSystemService(Context.WINDOW_SERVICE) to get one of these.

Each window manager instance is bound to a particular Display. To obtain a WindowManager for a different display, use createDisplayContext(Display) to obtain a Context for that display, then use Context.getSystemService(Context.WINDOW_SERVICE) to get the WindowManager.

The simplest way to show a window on another display is to create a Presentation. The presentation will automatically obtain a WindowManager and Context for that display.
