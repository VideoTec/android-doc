     * Return the drawable's bounds Rect. Note: for efficiency, the returned
     * object may be the same object stored in the drawable (though this is not
     * guaranteed), so if a persistent copy of the bounds is needed, call
     * copyBounds(rect) instead.
     * You should also not change the object returned by this method as it may
     * be the same object stored in the drawable.
     *
     * @return The bounds of the drawable (which may change later, so caller
     *         beware). DO NOT ALTER the returned object as it may change the
     *         stored bounds of this drawable.
