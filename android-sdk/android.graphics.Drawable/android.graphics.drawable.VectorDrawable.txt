 	   ↳	android.graphics.drawable.VectorDrawable
	   
This lets you create a drawable based on an XML vector graphic.

Note: To optimize for the re-drawing performance, 
one bitmap cache is created for each VectorDrawable. 
Therefore, referring to the same VectorDrawable means sharing the same bitmap cache. 
If these references don't agree upon on the same size, 
the bitmap will be recreated and redrawn every time size is changed. 

In other words, if a VectorDrawable is used for different sizes, 
it is more efficient to create multiple VectorDrawables, one for each size.

VectorDrawable can be defined in an XML file with the <vector> element.
