Are you sure You import import com.yourcompanyname.product.R 
instead of
import android.R;

replace "mipmap" with "drawable"

I had the same problem while following a tutorial and 
i found out that my AndroidManifest.xml file had the following code :-

android:icon="@mipmap/ic_launcher

so I changed R.drawable to R.mipmap it solved the problem . 
Wherever I found out drawable I replaced it with mipmap. 
Good to check for mipmap with android studio 1.1. for more info
