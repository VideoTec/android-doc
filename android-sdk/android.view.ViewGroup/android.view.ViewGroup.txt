A ViewGroup is a special view that can contain other views (called children.) 
The view group is the base class for layouts and views containers. 
This class also defines the ViewGroup.LayoutParams class 
which serves as the base class for layouts parameters.

Also see ViewGroup.LayoutParams for layout attributes.
