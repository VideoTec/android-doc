Defines the responsibilities for a class that will be a parent of a View. 
This is the API that a view sees when it wants to interact with its parent.

It's safe. Every single implementation, in the Android SDK, of ViewParent is a ViewGroup.

But remember that instanceof also checks for nullity. You could write :

if (!(getParent() instanceof ViewGroup)){
  throw new IllegalStateException("View does not have a parent, it cannot be rootview!");
}
ViewGroup parent = (ViewGroup) getParent();
