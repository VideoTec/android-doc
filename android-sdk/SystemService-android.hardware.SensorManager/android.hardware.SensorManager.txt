java.lang.Object
   ↳	android.hardware.SensorManager
   
SensorManager lets you access the device's sensors. 
Get an instance of this class by calling Context.getSystemService() 
with the argument SENSOR_SERVICE.

Always make sure to disable sensors you don't need, 
especially when your activity is paused. 
Failing to do so can drain the battery in just a few hours. 
Note that the system will not disable sensors automatically when the screen turns off.

disable sensors 方法：
mSensorManager.unregisterListener(this);

Don't forget to un-register the sensor 
because android system won't release the sensors automatically 
after the usage. 
If you forget to do so music player and other application 
which uses music player will behave odd.
