public void showAsDropDown (View anchor, int xoff, int yoff, int gravity)

Added in API level 19

Displays the content view in a popup window anchored to the corner of another view. The window is positioned according to the specified gravity and offset by the specified x and y coordinates.

If there is not enough room on screen to show the popup in its entirety, this method tries to find a parent scroll view to scroll. If no parent view can be scrolled, the specified vertical gravity will be ignored and the popup will anchor itself such that it is visible.

If the view later scrolls to move anchor to a different location, the popup will be moved correspondingly.

Parameters
anchor	the view on which to pin the popup window
xoff	A horizontal offset from the anchor in pixels
yoff	A vertical offset from the anchor in pixels
gravity	Alignment of the popup relative to the anchor
