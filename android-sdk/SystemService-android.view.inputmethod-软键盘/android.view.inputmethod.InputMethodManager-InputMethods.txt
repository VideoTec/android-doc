Input Methods

An input method (IME) is implemented as a Service, typically deriving from InputMethodService. 
It must provide the core InputMethod interface, though this is normally handled by InputMethodService and implementors will only need to deal with the higher-level API there.

See the InputMethodService class for more information on implementing IMEs.
