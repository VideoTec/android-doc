You might want to take a look at this issue. 
Having a focusable item in a row of a ListView causes the OnItemClickListener NOT to be invoked. 
However, that does not mean you cannot have focusable/clickable items in a row, 
there are some workarounds like this one.

Also, you can take a look at the Call Logs screen. 
It has a ListView with clickable item(the call icon on the right). See Source code here
