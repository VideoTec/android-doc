错误的原因：
protected void layoutChildren() {
.......
            } else if (mItemCount != mAdapter.getCount()) {
                throw new IllegalStateException("The content of the adapter has changed but "
                        + "ListView did not receive a notification. Make sure the content of "
                        + "your adapter is not modified from a background thread, but only from "
                        + "the UI thread. Make sure your adapter calls notifyDataSetChanged() "
                        + "when its content changes. [in ListView(" + getId() + ", " + getClass()
                        + ") with Adapter(" + mAdapter.getClass() + ")]");
            }
.......
}

第一种方法：
I solved this by have 2 Lists. One list I use for only the adapter, and I do all data changes/updates on the other list. This allows me to do updates on one list in a background thread, and then update the "adapter" list in the main/UI thread:

第二种方法：
I had the same problem, but I fixed it using the method

requestLayout();
from the class ListView

会修改，ListView.mItemCount 值的方法有：
public void setAdapter(ListAdapter adapter)
protected void onMeasure(int widthMeasureSpec, int heightMeasureSpec)

第三种方法：
Then it creates the adapter and deliver it to the activity where on ui thread i call setAdapter.
