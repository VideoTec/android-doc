列表中，多个TextureView, 多个mediaplayer播放，
有时其中一个播放窗口，会闪烁。

只要调了 listview 的分隔线，就出问题。
不设置 分隔线，播放正常。

最后找到原因：和分隔线没关系
是使用的自义 listview 的问题。
如果使用原始 listview 没有问题。

This was a bug that got fixed in the L release. 
Issue could occur when multiple TextureViews were onscreen at once.

The problem was that drawing IDs for the TextureViews were being incorrectly cached, 
so it was possible for multiple TextureViews 
that were onscreen to swap rendering content at draw time.

Adding extra invalidates is an appropriate way to work around the issue, 
but if that doesn't work alternate options are 
1) use SurfaceView, or 
2) if you're using canvas to draw, 
use a custom View to render your content 
(and you can use LAYER_TYPE_SOFTWARE if your content can't be rendered in HW)
