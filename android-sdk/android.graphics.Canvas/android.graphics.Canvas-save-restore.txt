----------------------------------
public void restore ()
----------------------------------

Added in API level 1

This call balances a previous call to save(), and is used to remove all modifications to the matrix/clip state since the last save call. It is an error to call restore() more times than save() was called.

----------------------------------
public int save ()
----------------------------------

Added in API level 1

Saves the current matrix and clip onto a private stack.

Subsequent calls to translate,scale,rotate,skew,concat or clipRect, clipPath will all operate as usual, but when the balancing call to restore() is made, those calls will be forgotten, and the settings that existed before the save() will be reinstated.

Returns
The value to pass to restoreToCount() to balance this save()

----------------------------------
public int save (int saveFlags)
----------------------------------

Added in API level 1
Based on saveFlags, can save the current matrix and clip onto a private stack.

Note: if possible, use the parameter-less save(). It is simpler and faster than individually disabling the saving of matrix or clip with this method.

Subsequent calls to translate,scale,rotate,skew,concat or clipRect, clipPath will all operate as usual, but when the balancing call to restore() is made, those calls will be forgotten, and the settings that existed before the save() will be reinstated.

Parameters

saveFlags
flag bits that specify which parts of the Canvas state to save/restore

Returns
The value to pass to restoreToCount() to balance this save()
