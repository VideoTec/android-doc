-------------------------------------------
下面两种设置方法是等价的：
-------------------------------------------
1） mParameters.setRecordingHint(true)
2） mParameters.set("recording-hint", "true");

作用 提高录制模式的性能
-------------------------------------------
Sets recording mode hint. 
This tells the camera that 
the intent of the application is to record videos start(), 
not to take still pictures 
takePicture
(Camera.ShutterCallback, Camera.PictureCallback, Camera.PictureCallback, Camera.PictureCallback). 
Using this hint can allow MediaRecorder.start() 
to start faster or with fewer glitches on output. 
This should be called before starting preview for the best result, 
but can be changed while the preview is active. The default value is false. 
The app 
can still call takePicture() when the hint is true or 
call MediaRecorder.start() when the hint is false. 
But the performance may be worse.

Parameters
hint	true if the apps intend to record videos using MediaRecorder.

I've found some odd behavior around Camera.Parameters.setRecordingHint 
that I'd like to understand better.

If I set it to true, 
the size of the preview image can come back 
different from what I pass to setPreviewSize. 
It depends on what size I set it to-- some aspect ratios work and some don't.

See the screenshots below-- 
setPreviewSize has been set to 640x480 for both, 
but one has setRecordingHint to true and the other to false. 
I have the code that produces this effect on GitHub.

应该同时设置 video-size

You need to set video-size parameter to the correct value. 
I had the same problem - preview size was 640x480 and 
the preview appeared stretched while using setRecordingHint(true). 
I then used getParameters().flatten() 
to print out all parameters set for my Camera device. 
My video-size parameter was actually 
set to 1920x1080 causing the incorrect aspect ratio. 
You can change this parameter using params.set("video-size", "WxH"). 
Only then is the aspect ratio correct.
