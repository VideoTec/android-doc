public static final String FOCUS_MODE_CONTINUOUS_VIDEO

Added in API level 9
Continuous auto focus mode intended for video recording. The camera continuously tries to focus. This is the best choice for video recording because the focus changes smoothly . Applications still can call takePicture(Camera.ShutterCallback, Camera.PictureCallback, Camera.PictureCallback) in this mode but the subject may not be in focus. Auto focus starts when the parameter is set.

Since API level 14, applications can call autoFocus(AutoFocusCallback) in this mode. The focus callback will immediately return with a boolean that indicates whether the focus is sharp or not. The focus position is locked after autoFocus call. If applications want to resume the continuous focus, cancelAutoFocus must be called. Restarting the preview will not resume the continuous autofocus. To stop continuous focus, applications should change the focus mode to other modes.
