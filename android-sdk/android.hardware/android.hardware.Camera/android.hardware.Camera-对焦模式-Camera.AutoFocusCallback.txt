android.hardware.Camera.AutoFocusCallback

Callback interface used to notify on completion of camera auto focus.

Devices that do not support auto-focus will receive a "fake" callback to this interface. If your application needs auto-focus and should not be installed on devices without auto-focus, you must declare that your app uses the android.hardware.camera.autofocus feature, in the <uses-feature> manifest element.
