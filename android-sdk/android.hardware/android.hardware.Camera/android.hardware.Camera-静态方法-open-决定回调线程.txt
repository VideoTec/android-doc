Callbacks from other methods are delivered to the event loop of the thread which called open().
 
If this thread has no event loop, 
then callbacks are delivered to the main application event loop. 

If there is no main application event loop, callbacks are not delivered.

    public static Camera open(int cameraId) {
        return new Camera(cameraId);
    }

下面的代码：
构建Camera对象，生成处理回调的 Handler:

        Looper looper;
        if ((looper = Looper.myLooper()) != null) {
            mEventHandler = new EventHandler(this, looper);
        } else if ((looper = Looper.getMainLooper()) != null) {
            mEventHandler = new EventHandler(this, looper);
        } else {
            mEventHandler = null;
        }
