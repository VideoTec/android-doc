public int orientation

The orientation of the camera image. The value is the angle that the camera image needs to be rotated clockwise so it shows correctly on the display in its natural orientation. It should be 0, 90, 180, or 270.

For example, suppose a device has a naturally tall screen. The back-facing camera sensor is mounted in landscape. You are looking at the screen.
 
If the top side of the camera sensor 
is aligned with the right edge of the screen in natural orientation, the value should be 90.

If the top side of a front-facing camera sensor 
is aligned with the right of the screen, the value should be 270.
