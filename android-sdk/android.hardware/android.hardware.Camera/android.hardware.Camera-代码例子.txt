--------------------------------------------------------------------
To take pictures with this class, use the following steps:
--------------------------------------------------------------------

第1步
Obtain an instance of Camera from open(int).

第2步
Get existing (default) settings with getParameters().

第3步
If necessary, modify the returned Camera.Parameters object and call setParameters(Camera.Parameters).

第4步
If desired, call setDisplayOrientation(int).

第5步
Important: Pass a fully initialized SurfaceHolder to setPreviewDisplay(SurfaceHolder). Without a surface, the camera will be unable to start the preview.

第6步
Important: Call startPreview() to start updating the preview surface. Preview must be started before you can take a picture.

第7步
When you want, call takePicture(Camera.ShutterCallback, Camera.PictureCallback, Camera.PictureCallback, Camera.PictureCallback) to capture a photo. Wait for the callbacks to provide the actual image data.

第8步
After taking a picture, preview display will have stopped. To take more photos, call startPreview() again first.

第9步
Call stopPreview() to stop updating the preview surface.

第10步
Important: Call release() to release the camera for use by other applications. Applications should release the camera immediately in onPause() (and re-open() it in onResume()).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
To quickly switch to video recording mode, use these steps:
--------------------------------------------------------------------
第1步
Obtain and initialize a Camera and start preview as described above.

第2步
Call unlock() to allow the media process to access the camera.

第3步
Pass the camera to setCamera(Camera). See MediaRecorder information about video recording.

第4步
When finished recording, call reconnect() to re-acquire and re-lock the camera.

第5步
If desired, restart preview and take more photos or videos.

第6步
Call stopPreview() and release() as described above.

This class is not thread-safe, and is meant for use from one event thread. 
Most long-running operations (preview, focus, photo capture, etc) 
happen asynchronously and invoke callbacks as necessary. 
Callbacks will be invoked on the event thread open(int) was called from. 
This class's methods must never be called from multiple threads at once.

Caution: Different Android-powered devices may have different hardware specifications, such as megapixel ratings and auto-focus capabilities. In order for your application to be compatible with more devices, you should not make assumptions about the device camera specifications.
