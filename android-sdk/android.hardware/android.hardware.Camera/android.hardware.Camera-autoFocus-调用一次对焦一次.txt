public final void autoFocus (Camera.AutoFocusCallback cb)

Starts camera auto-focus and registers a callback function to run when the camera is focused. This method is only valid when preview is active (between startPreview() and before stopPreview()).

Callers should check getFocusMode() to determine if this method should be called. If the camera does not support auto-focus, it is a no-op and onAutoFocus(boolean, Camera) callback will be called immediately.

If your application should not be installed on devices without auto-focus, you must declare that your application uses auto-focus with the <uses-feature> manifest element.

If the current flash mode is not FLASH_MODE_OFF, flash-闪光灯 may be fired during auto-focus, depending on the driver and camera hardware.

Auto-exposure lock getAutoExposureLock() and auto-white balance locks getAutoWhiteBalanceLock() do not change during and after autofocus. But auto-focus routine may stop auto-exposure and auto-white balance transiently during focusing.

Stopping preview with stopPreview(), or triggering still image capture with takePicture(Camera.ShutterCallback, Camera.PictureCallback, Camera.PictureCallback), will not change the the focus position. Applications must call cancelAutoFocus to reset the focus.

If autofocus is successful, consider using MediaActionSound to properly play back an autofocus success sound to the user.

FOCUS_MODE_AUTO
FOCUS_MODE_MACRO
FOCUS_MODE_FIXED 都不影响 mCamera.autoFocus 调用

FOCUS_MODE_CONTINUOUS_VIDEO
FOCUS_MODE_CONTINUOUS_PICTURE
也可以调用 mCamera.autoFocus, 但是
The focus position is locked after autoFocus call. - 不会持续变焦了
If applications want to resume the continuous focus, cancelAutoFocus must be called.
