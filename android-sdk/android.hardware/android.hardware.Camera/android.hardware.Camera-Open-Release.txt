Camera 没有构造函数，使用下面的静态方法创建 Camera 对象

static Camera	open(int cameraId)
Creates a new Camera object to access a particular hardware camera.
static Camera	open()
Creates a new Camera object to access the first back-facing camera on the device.

static Camera	open(int cameraId)
Creates a new Camera object to access a particular hardware camera.
cameraId < getNumberOfCameras

static Camera	open()
Creates a new Camera object to access the first back-facing camera on the device.

Open RuntimeException异常
if opening the camera fails (for example, if the camera is in use by another process or device policy manager has disabled the camera).

回调 - 线程
Callbacks from other methods are delivered to the event loop of the thread which called open(). 
If this thread has no event loop, then callbacks are delivered to the main application event loop. 
If there is no main application event loop, callbacks are not delivered.

阻塞
On some devices, this method may take a long time to complete. 
It is best to call this method from a worker thread (possibly using AsyncTask) to avoid blocking the main application UI thread.

Release
You must call release() when you are done using the camera, otherwise it will remain locked and be unavailable to other applications.
