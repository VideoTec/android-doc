    错误
    No enclosing instance of type Camera is accessible. Must qualify the allocation with an 
    enclosing instance of type Camera (e.g. x.new A() where x is an instance of Camera).

    Camera cam = Camera.open();
    Size size = cam.new Size(100, 100);
    OK. This seems to be a non static inner class
