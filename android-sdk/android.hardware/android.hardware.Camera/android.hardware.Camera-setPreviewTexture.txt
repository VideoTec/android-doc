    /**
     * Sets the {@link SurfaceTexture} to be used for live preview.
     * Either a surface or surface texture is necessary for preview, and
     * preview is necessary to take pictures.  The same surface texture can be
     * re-set without harm.  Setting a preview surface texture will un-set any
     * preview surface that was set via {@link #setPreviewDisplay}.
     *
     * <p>This method must be called before {@link #startPreview()}.  The
     * one exception is that if the preview surface texture is not set (or set
     * to null) before startPreview() is called, then this method may be called
     * once with a non-null parameter to set the preview surface.  (This allows
     * camera setup and surface creation to happen in parallel, saving time.)
     * The preview surface texture may not otherwise change while preview is
     * running.
     *
     * <p>The timestamps provided by {@link SurfaceTexture#getTimestamp()} for a
     * SurfaceTexture set as the preview texture have an unspecified zero point,
     * and cannot be directly compared between different cameras or different
     * instances of the same camera, or across multiple runs of the same
     * program.
     *
     * <p>If you are using the preview data to create video or still images,
     * strongly consider using {@link android.media.MediaActionSound} to
     * properly indicate image capture or recording start/stop to the user.</p>
     *
     * @see android.media.MediaActionSound
     * @see android.graphics.SurfaceTexture
     * @see android.view.TextureView
     * @param surfaceTexture the {@link SurfaceTexture} to which the preview
     *     images are to be sent or null to remove the current preview surface
     *     texture
     * @throws IOException if the method fails (for example, if the surface
     *     texture is unavailable or unsuitable).
