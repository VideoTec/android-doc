public final void reconnect ()

Added in API level 8
Reconnects to the camera service after another process used it. After unlock() is called, another process may use the camera; when the process is done, you must reconnect to the camera, which will re-acquire the lock and allow you to continue using the camera.

Since API level 14, camera is automatically locked for applications in start(). Applications can use the camera (ex: zoom) after recording starts. There is no need to call this after recording starts or stops.

If you are not recording video, you probably do not need this method.

Throws
IOException	if a connection cannot be re-established (for example, if the camera is still in use by another process).
