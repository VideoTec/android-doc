     * Create and/or open a database that will be used for reading and writing.
     * The first time this is called, the database will be opened and
     * {@link #onCreate}, {@link #onUpgrade} and/or {@link #onOpen} will be
     * called.
     *
     * <p>Once opened successfully, the database is cached, so you can
     * call this method every time you need to write to the database.
     * (Make sure to call {@link #close} when you no longer need the database.)
     * Errors such as bad permissions or a full disk may cause this method
     * to fail, but future attempts may succeed if the problem is fixed.</p>
     *
     * <p class="caution">Database upgrade may take a long time, you
     * should not call this method from the application main thread, including
     * from {@link android.content.ContentProvider#onCreate ContentProvider.onCreate()}.
     *
     * @throws SQLiteException if the database cannot be opened for writing
     * @return a read/write database object valid until {@link #close} is called
