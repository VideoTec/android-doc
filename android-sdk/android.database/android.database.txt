Contains classes to explore data returned through a content provider.
If you need to manage data in a private database, 
use the android.database.sqlite classes. 

These classes are used to manage the Cursor object returned from a content provider query. 
Databases are usually created and opened with openOrCreateDatabase(String, int, SQLiteDatabase.CursorFactory) 
To make requests through content providers, you can use the content.ContentResolver class.

All databases are stored on the device in /data/data/<package_name>/databases

db=SQLiteDatabase.openOrCreateDatabase("/data/data/com.lingdududu.db/databases/stu.db",null);

SQLiteOpenHelper 该类是SQLiteDatabase一个辅助类
