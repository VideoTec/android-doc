There are two options for creating and updating databases.

One is to create a database externally, 
then place it in the assets folder of the project and 
then copy the entire database from there. 
This is much quicker if the database has a lot of tables and other components. 

Upgrades are triggered 
by changing the database version number in the res/values/strings.xml file. 
Upgrades would then be accomplished by 
1）creating a new database externally, 
2）replacing the old database in the assets folder with the new database, 
3）saving the old database in internal storage under another name, 
4）copying the new database from the assets folder into internal storage, 
5）transferring all of the data 
from the old database (that was renamed earlier) 
into the new database and 
finally deleting the old database.
 
You can create a database originally 
by using the SQLite Manager FireFox plugin 
to execute your creation sql statements.

The other option is to create a database internally from a sql file. 
This is not as quick but 
the delay would probably be unnoticeable to the users 
if the database has only a few tables. 
Upgrades are triggered 
by changing the database version number in the res/values/strings.xml file. 
Upgrades would then be accomplished by processing an upgrade sql file. 
The data in the database will remain unchanged except 
when its container is removed, for example dropping a table.
