Class Overview

Exposes methods to manage a SQLite database.

SQLiteDatabase has methods to 
1）create, delete, execute SQL commands, and 
2）perform other common database management tasks.

See the Notepad sample application in the SDK for an example of creating and managing a database.

Database names must be unique within an application, not across all applications.
