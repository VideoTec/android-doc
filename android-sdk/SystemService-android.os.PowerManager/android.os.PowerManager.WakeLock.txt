A wake lock is a mechanism to indicate that your application needs to have the device stay on.

Any application using a WakeLock 
must request the android.permission.WAKE_LOCK permission 
in an <uses-permission> element of the application's manifest. 
Obtain a wake lock by calling newWakeLock(int, String).

Call acquire() to acquire the wake lock and 
force the device to stay on at the level that was requested 
when the wake lock was created.

Call release() when you are done and don't need the lock anymore. 
It is very important to do this as soon as possible 
to avoid running down the device's battery excessively.
