If using this to keep the screen on, you should strongly consider using FLAG_KEEP_SCREEN_ON instead. This window flag will be correctly managed by the platform as the user moves between applications and doesn't require a special permission.

加在Activity的onCreate里
getWindow().addFlags(WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_KEEP_SCREEN_ON);

A wakelock gives you way more control (Like waking the phone to download something without turning the screen off) and requires your application to hold the wakelock permission.

Therefore FLAG_KEEP_SCREEN_ON is recommended if all you want is to keep the screen on while your window is visible.
