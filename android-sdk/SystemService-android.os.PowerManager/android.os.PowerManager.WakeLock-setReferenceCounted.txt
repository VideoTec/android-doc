public void setReferenceCounted (boolean value)

Added in API level 1
Sets whether this WakeLock is reference counted.

Wake locks are reference counted by default. 
If a wake lock is reference counted, 
then each call to acquire() 
must be balanced by an equal number of calls to release(). 

If a wake lock is not reference counted, 
then one call to release() is sufficient 
to undo the effect of all previous calls to acquire().

Parameters
value
True to make the wake lock reference counted, false to make the wake lock non-reference counted.
