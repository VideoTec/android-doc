创建锁：
PowerManager.WakeLock newWakeLock(int levelAndFlags, String tag)
Creates a new wake lock with the specified level and flags.

锁的级别：
The following wake lock levels are defined, with varying effects on system power. 
These levels are mutually exclusive - you may only specify one of them.

Flag Value                  CPU     Screen    Keyboard
PARTIAL_WAKE_LOCK           On*     Off         Off
SCREEN_DIM_WAKE_LOCK        On      Dim         Off
SCREEN_BRIGHT_WAKE_LOCK     On      Bright      Off
FULL_WAKE_LOCK              On      Bright      Bright

*If you hold a partial wake lock, the CPU will continue to run, 
regardless of any display timeouts or the state of the screen 
and even after the user presses the power button. 
In all other wake locks, the CPU will run, 
but the user can still put the device to sleep using the power button.

In addition, you can add two more flags, which affect behavior of the screen only. 
These flags have no effect when combined with a PARTIAL_WAKE_LOCK.

1）ACQUIRE_CAUSES_WAKEUP
Normal wake locks don't actually turn on the illumination. 
Instead, they cause the illumination to remain on once it turns on (e.g. from user activity). 
This flag will force the screen and/or keyboard to turn on immediately, 
when the WakeLock is acquired. 
A typical use would be for notifications which are important for the user to see immediately.

2）ON_AFTER_RELEASE
If this flag is set, the user activity timer will be reset when the WakeLock is released, 
causing the illumination to remain on a bit longer. 
This can be used to reduce flicker if you are cycling between wake lock conditions.

各种锁的类型对CPU 、屏幕、键盘的影响：

级别：
PARTIAL_WAKE_LOCK:保持CPU 运转，屏幕和键盘灯有可能是关闭的。
SCREEN_DIM_WAKE_LOCK：保持CPU 运转，允许保持屏幕显示但有可能是灰的，允许关闭键盘灯
SCREEN_BRIGHT_WAKE_LOCK：保持CPU 运转，允许保持屏幕高亮显示，允许关闭键盘灯
FULL_WAKE_LOCK：保持CPU 运转，保持屏幕高亮显示，键盘灯也保持亮度

FLAGS：
ACQUIRE_CAUSES_WAKEUP：强制使屏幕亮起，这种锁主要针对一些必须通知用户的操作.
ON_AFTER_RELEASE：当锁被释放时，保持屏幕亮起一段时间
