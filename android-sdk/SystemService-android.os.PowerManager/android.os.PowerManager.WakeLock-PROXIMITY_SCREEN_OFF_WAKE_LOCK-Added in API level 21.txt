PROXIMITY_SCREEN_OFF_WAKE_LOCK

Added in API level 21

int PROXIMITY_SCREEN_OFF_WAKE_LOCK
Wake lock level: Turns the screen off when the proximity sensor activates.

If the proximity sensor detects 
that an object is nearby, the screen turns off immediately. 
Shortly after the object moves away, the screen turns on again.

A proximity wake lock does not prevent the device from falling asleep 
unlike FULL_WAKE_LOCK, SCREEN_BRIGHT_WAKE_LOCK and SCREEN_DIM_WAKE_LOCK. 
If there is no user activity and no other wake locks are held, 
then the device will fall asleep (and lock) as usual. 
However, the device will not fall asleep 
while the screen has been turned off by the proximity sensor 
because it effectively counts as ongoing user activity.

Since not all devices have proximity sensors, 
use isWakeLockLevelSupported(int) to determine whether this wake lock level is supported.

Cannot be used with ACQUIRE_CAUSES_WAKEUP.

Constant Value: 32 (0x00000020)

注意：低于 api 21 版本中也可以使用
                PowerManager pM = (PowerManager) getSystemService(POWER_SERVICE);
                //public static final int PROXIMITY_SCREEN_OFF_WAKE_LOCK = 0x00000020;
                mProximityScreenOffWakeLock = pM.newWakeLock(0x00000020, TAG);

Even though it says API level 21 is required, it seems to be backwards compatible, 
since the flag was always there, just hidden

PROXIMITY_SCREEN_OFF_WAKE_LOCK is public as of API level 21 (Lollipop).

Note that with Android 4.2.1 the method getSupportedWakeLockFlags 
no longer exists and you need to use isWakeLockLevelSupported
