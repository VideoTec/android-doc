Provides information about the size and density of a logical display.

The display area is described in two different ways.

The application display area specifies the part of the display that may contain an application window, excluding the system decorations. The application display area may be smaller than the real display area because the system subtracts the space needed for decor elements such as the status bar. Use the following methods to query the application display area: getSize(Point), getRectSize(Rect) and getMetrics(DisplayMetrics).

The real display area specifies the part of the display that contains content including the system decorations. Even so, the real display area may be smaller than the physical size of the display if the window manager is emulating a smaller display using (adb shell am display-size). Use the following methods to query the real display area: getRealSize(Point), getRealMetrics(DisplayMetrics).

A logical display does not necessarily represent a particular physical display device such as the built-in screen or an external monitor. The contents of a logical display may be presented on one or more physical displays according to the devices that are currently attached and whether mirroring has been enabled.
