public abstract Display getDefaultDisplay ()

Added in API level 1
Returns the Display upon which this WindowManager instance will create new windows.

Despite the name of this method, the display that is returned is not necessarily the primary display of the system (see DEFAULT_DISPLAY). The returned display could instead be a secondary display that this window manager instance is managing. Think of it as the display that this WindowManager instance uses by default.

To create windows on a different display, you need to obtain a WindowManager for that Display. (See the WindowManager class documentation for more information.)

Returns
The display that this window manager is managing.
