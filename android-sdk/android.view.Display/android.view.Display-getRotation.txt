public int getRotation ()

Added in API level 8
Returns the rotation of the screen from its "natural" orientation. 

旋转角度都是指顺时针方向的
The returned value may be 
Surface.ROTATION_0 (no rotation), 
Surface.ROTATION_90, 
Surface.ROTATION_180, or 
Surface.ROTATION_270. 

For example, if a device has a naturally tall screen, 
and the user has turned it on its side to go into a landscape orientation, the value returned here may be either Surface.ROTATION_90 or Surface.ROTATION_270 depending on the direction it was turned. 

理解下面的解释：这个角度是屏幕上的图像的旋转角度
The angle is the rotation of the drawn graphics on the screen, which is the opposite direction of the physical rotation of the device. For example, if the device is rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise, to compensate rendering will be rotated by 90 degrees clockwise and thus the returned value here will be Surface.ROTATION_90.
