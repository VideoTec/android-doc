android.view.Window

/**
 * Abstract base class for a top-level window look and behavior policy.  An
 * instance of this class should be used as the top-level view added to the
 * window manager. It provides standard UI policies such as a background, title
 * area, default key processing, etc.
 *
 * <p>The only existing implementation of this abstract class is
 * android.view.PhoneWindow, which you should instantiate when needing a
 * Window.
