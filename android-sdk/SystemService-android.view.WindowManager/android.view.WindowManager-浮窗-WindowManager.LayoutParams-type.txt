         * The general type of window.  There are three main classes of
         * window types:
         * <ul>
         * <li> <strong>Application windows</strong> (ranging from
         * {@link #FIRST_APPLICATION_WINDOW} to
         * {@link #LAST_APPLICATION_WINDOW}) are normal top-level application
         * windows.  For these types of windows, the {@link #token} must be
         * set to the token of the activity they are a part of (this will
         * normally be done for you if {@link #token} is null).
         * <li> <strong>Sub-windows</strong> (ranging from
         * {@link #FIRST_SUB_WINDOW} to
         * {@link #LAST_SUB_WINDOW}) are associated with another top-level
         * window.  For these types of windows, the {@link #token} must be
         * the token of the window it is attached to.
         * <li> <strong>System windows</strong> (ranging from
         * {@link #FIRST_SYSTEM_WINDOW} to
         * {@link #LAST_SYSTEM_WINDOW}) are special types of windows for
         * use by the system for specific purposes.  They should not normally
         * be used by applications, and a special permission is required
         * to use them.
         * </ul>
