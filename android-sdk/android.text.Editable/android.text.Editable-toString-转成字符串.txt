If I understand correctly, 
you want to get the String of an Editable object, right? 
If yes, try using toString().

Based on this code (which you provided in response to Alex's answer):

Editable newTxt=(Editable)userName1.getText(); 
String newString = newTxt.toString();

It looks like you're trying to get the text out of a TextView or EditText. 
If that's the case then this should work:

String newString = userName1.getText().toString();
