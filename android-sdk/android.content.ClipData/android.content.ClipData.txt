Class Overview

Representation of a clipped data on the clipboard.

ClippedData is a complex type containing one or Item instances, each of which can hold one or more representations of an item of data. For display to the user, it also has a label and iconic representation.

A ClipData contains a ClipDescription, which describes important meta-data about the clip. In particular, its getDescription().getMimeType(int) must return correct MIME type(s) describing the data in the clip. For help in correctly constructing a clip with the correct MIME type, use newPlainText(CharSequence, CharSequence), newUri(ContentResolver, CharSequence, Uri), and newIntent(CharSequence, Intent).

Each Item instance can be one of three main classes of data: a simple CharSequence of text, a single Intent object, or a Uri. See ClipData.Item for more details.
