Android offers a custom 2D graphics library for drawing shapes and images. 
The android.graphics.drawable package is where you'll find the common classes used for drawing in two-dimensions.

This document discusses the basics of using Drawable objects to draw graphics and 
how to use a couple subclasses of the Drawable class. 
For information on using Drawables to do frame-by-frame animation, see Drawable Animation.

A Drawable is a general abstraction for "something that can be drawn." 
You'll discover that the Drawable class extends to define a variety of specific kinds of drawable graphics, 
including BitmapDrawable, ShapeDrawable, PictureDrawable, LayerDrawable, and several more. 
Of course, you can also extend these to define your own custom Drawable objects that behave in unique ways.

There are three ways to define and instantiate a Drawable: 
using an image saved in your project resources; 
using an XML file that defines the Drawable properties; or 
using the normal class constructors. 
Below, we'll discuss each the first two techniques (using constructors is nothing new for an experienced developer).
