public static Bitmap decodeStream (InputStream is)

Added in API level 1
Decode an input stream into a bitmap. If the input stream is null, or cannot be used to decode a bitmap, the function returns null. The stream's position will be where ever it was after the encoded data was read.

Parameters
is	The input stream that holds the raw data to be decoded into a bitmap.
Returns
The decoded bitmap, or null if the image data could not be decoded.
public static Bitmap decodeStream (InputStream is, Rect outPadding, BitmapFactory.Options opts)

Added in API level 1
Decode an input stream into a bitmap. If the input stream is null, or cannot be used to decode a bitmap, the function returns null. The stream's position will be where ever it was after the encoded data was read.

Parameters
is	The input stream that holds the raw data to be decoded into a bitmap.
outPadding	If not null, return the padding rect for the bitmap if it exists, otherwise set padding to [-1,-1,-1,-1]. If no bitmap is returned (null) then padding is unchanged.
opts	null-ok; Options that control downsampling and whether the image should be completely decoded, or just is size returned.
Returns
The decoded bitmap, or null if the image data could not be decoded, or, if opts is non-null, if opts requested only the size be returned (in opts.outWidth and opts.outHeight)
Prior to KITKAT, if is.markSupported() returns true, is.mark(1024) would be called. As of KITKAT, this is no longer the case
