public boolean compress (Bitmap.CompressFormat format, int quality, OutputStream stream)

Added in API level 1
Write a compressed version of the bitmap to the specified outputstream. If this returns true, the bitmap can be reconstructed by passing a corresponding inputstream to BitmapFactory.decodeStream(). Note: not all Formats support all bitmap configs directly, so it is possible that the returned bitmap from BitmapFactory could be in a different bitdepth, and/or may have lost per-pixel alpha (e.g. JPEG only supports opaque pixels).

Parameters

format
The format of the compressed image

quality
Hint to the compressor, 0-100. 0 meaning compress for small size, 100 meaning compress for max quality. Some formats, like PNG which is lossless, will ignore the quality setting

stream
The outputstream to write the compressed data.

Returns
true if successfully compressed to the specified stream.
