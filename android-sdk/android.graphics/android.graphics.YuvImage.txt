NV21 图片数据处理类
android.graphics.YuvImage

YuvImage contains YUV data and provides a method that compresses a region of the YUV data to a Jpeg. 
The YUV data should be provided as a single byte array irrespective of the number of image planes in it. 
Currently only ImageFormat.NV21 and ImageFormat.YUY2 are supported. 
To compress a rectangle region in the YUV data, users have to specify the region by left, top, width and height.

构建
------------------------------

public YuvImage (byte[] yuv, int format, int width, int height, int[] strides)

Added in API level 8
Construct an YuvImage.

Parameters
yuv	The YUV data. In the case of more than one image plane, all the planes must be concatenated into a single byte array.
format	The YUV data format as defined in ImageFormat.  	android.graphics.ImageFormat.NV21
width	The width of the YuvImage.
height	The height of the YuvImage.
strides	(Optional) Row bytes of each image plane. 
        If yuv contains padding, the stride of each image must be provided. 
		If strides is null, the method assumes no padding and derives the row bytes by format and width itself.
Throws
IllegalArgumentException	if format is not support; width or height <= 0; or yuv is null.

public boolean compressToJpeg (Rect rectangle, int quality, OutputStream stream)

Added in API level 8
Compress a rectangle region in the YuvImage to a jpeg. Only ImageFormat.NV21 and ImageFormat.YUY2 are supported for now.

Parameters
rectangle	The rectangle region to be compressed. 
            The medthod checks if rectangle is inside the image. 
			Also, the method modifies rectangle if the chroma pixels in it are not matched with the luma pixels in it.
quality		Hint to the compressor, 0-100. 0 meaning compress for small size, 100 meaning compress for max quality.
stream		OutputStream to write the compressed data.
Returns
True if the compression is successful.
Throws
IllegalArgumentException	if rectangle is invalid; quality is not within [0, 100]; or stream is null.

		}
		Rect rt = new Rect(0, 0, mCVideoWidth, mCVideoHeight);
		image.compressToJpeg(rt, 50, oFStream);
		Log.v("TTTTT", "onPreviewFrame" + SystemClock.currentThreadTimeMillis());
		mCamera.stopPreview();
