A Drawable that wraps a bitmap and can be tiled, stretched, or aligned. You can create a BitmapDrawable from a file path, an input stream, through XML inflation, or from a Bitmap object.

It can be defined in an XML file with the <bitmap> element. For more information, see the guide to Drawable Resources.

Also see the Bitmap class, which handles the management and transformation of raw bitmap graphics, and should be used when drawing to a Canvas.

例子
    public void setImageBitmap(Bitmap bm) {
        // if this is used frequently, may handle bitmaps explicitly
        // to reduce the intermediate drawable object
        setImageDrawable(new BitmapDrawable(mContext.getResources(), bm));
    }
