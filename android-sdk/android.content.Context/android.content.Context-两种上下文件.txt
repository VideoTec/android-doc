getApplicationContext() 返回应用的上下文，生命周期是整个应用，应用摧毁它才摧毁
Activity.this的context 返回当前activity的上下文，属于activity ，activity 摧毁他就摧毁
getBaseContext()  返回由构造函数指定或setBaseContext()设置的上下文

View.getContext(): 
Returns the context the view is currently running in. 
Usually the currently active Activity.

Activity.getApplicationContext(): 
Returns the context for the entire application (the process all the Activities are running inside of). 
Use this instead of the current Activity context if you need a context tied to the lifecycle of the entire application, 
not just the current Activity.

ContextWrapper.getBaseContext(): 
If you need access to a Context from within another context, 
you use a ContextWrapper. 
The Context referred to from inside that ContextWrapper is accessed via getBaseContext().

getApplicationContext() - Returns the context for all activities running in application.
getBaseContext() - If you want to access Context from another context within application you can access.
getContext() - Returns the context view only current running activity.
