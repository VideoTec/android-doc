android.content.ServiceConnection

Known Indirect Subclasses
MediaScannerConnection

Interface for monitoring the state of an application service. See Service and Context.bindService() for more information.

Like many callbacks from the system, the methods on this class are called from the main thread of your process.

public abstract void onServiceConnected (ComponentName name, IBinder service)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Added in API level 1
Called when a connection to the Service has been established, with the IBinder of the communication channel to the Service.

Parameters
name	The concrete component name of the service that has been connected.
service	The IBinder of the Service's communication channel, which you can now make calls on.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
public abstract void onServiceDisconnected (ComponentName name)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Added in API level 1
Called when a connection to the Service has been lost. This typically happens when the process hosting the service has crashed or been killed. This does not remove the ServiceConnection itself -- this binding to the service will remain active, and you will receive a call to onServiceConnected(ComponentName, IBinder) when the Service is next running.

Parameters
name	The concrete component name of the service whose connection has been lost.
