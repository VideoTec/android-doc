public Intent registerReceiver (BroadcastReceiver receiver, IntentFilter filter)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Added in API level 1
Register a BroadcastReceiver to be run in the main activity thread. The receiver will be called with any broadcast Intent that matches filter, in the main application thread.

The system may broadcast Intents that are "sticky" -- these stay around after the broadcast as finished, to be sent to any later registrations. If your IntentFilter matches one of these sticky Intents, that Intent will be returned by this function and sent to your receiver as if it had just been broadcast.

There may be multiple sticky Intents that match filter, in which case each of these will be sent to receiver. In this case, only one of these can be returned directly by the function; which of these that is returned is arbitrarily decided by the system.

If you know the Intent your are registering for is sticky, you can supply null for your receiver. In this case, no receiver is registered -- the function simply returns the sticky Intent that matches filter. In the case of multiple matches, the same rules as described above apply.

See BroadcastReceiver for more information on Intent broadcasts.

As of ICE_CREAM_SANDWICH, receivers registered with this method will correctly respect the setPackage(String) specified for an Intent being broadcast. Prior to that, it would be ignored and delivered to all matching registered receivers. Be careful if using this for security.

Note: this method cannot be called from a BroadcastReceiver component; that is, from a BroadcastReceiver that is declared in an application's manifest. It is okay, however, to call this method from another BroadcastReceiver that has itself been registered at run time with registerReceiver(BroadcastReceiver, IntentFilter), since the lifetime of such a registered BroadcastReceiver is tied to the object that registered it.

Parameters
receiver	The BroadcastReceiver to handle the broadcast.
filter	Selects the Intent broadcasts to be received.
Returns
The first sticky intent found that matches filter, or null if there are none.

public Intent registerReceiver (BroadcastReceiver receiver, IntentFilter filter, String broadcastPermission, Handler scheduler)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Added in API level 1
Register to receive intent broadcasts, to run in the context of scheduler. See registerReceiver(BroadcastReceiver, IntentFilter) for more information. This allows you to enforce permissions on who can broadcast intents to your receiver, or have the receiver run in a different thread than the main application thread.

Parameters

filter	Selects the Intent broadcasts to be received.
broadcastPermission	String naming a permissions that a broadcaster must hold in order to send an Intent to you. If null, no permission is required.
