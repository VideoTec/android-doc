AsyncTask is designed to be a helper class 
around Thread and Handler and 
does not constitute a generic threading framework. 
AsyncTasks should ideally be used for short operations 
(a few seconds at the most.) 
If you need to keep threads running for long periods of time, 
it is highly recommended you use the various APIs provided 
by the java.util.concurrent package 
such as Executor, ThreadPoolExecutor and FutureTask.
