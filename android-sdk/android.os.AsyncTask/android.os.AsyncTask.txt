Class Overview

AsyncTask enables proper and easy use of the UI thread. 
This class allows to perform background operations and publish results on the UI thread 
without having to manipulate threads and/or handlers.

AsyncTask is designed to be a helper class around Thread and Handler 
and does not constitute a generic threading framework. 
AsyncTasks should ideally be used for short operations (a few seconds at the most.) 
If you need to keep threads running for long periods of time, 
it is highly recommended you use the various APIs provided by the java.util.concurrent package 
such as Executor, ThreadPoolExecutor and FutureTask.

An asynchronous task is defined 
by a computation that runs on a background thread and 
whose result is published on the UI thread. 
An asynchronous task is defined by 

3 generic types, 
1）called Params, 
2）Progress and 
3）Result, and 

4 steps, called 
1）onPreExecute, 
2）doInBackground,       1. 接收execute传递的参数  2. 返回值传递给 onPostExecute
3）onProgressUpdate and 
4）onPostExecute
