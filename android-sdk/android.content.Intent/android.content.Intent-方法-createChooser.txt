createChooser
-------------------------------------------

Added in API level 1
Intent createChooser (Intent target, 
                CharSequence title)
Convenience function for creating a ACTION_CHOOSER Intent.

Builds a new ACTION_CHOOSER Intent that wraps the given target intent, 
also optionally supplying a title. 
If the target intent has specified 

FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION or 
FLAG_GRANT_WRITE_URI_PERMISSION, 

then these flags will also be set in the returned chooser intent, 
with its ClipData set appropriately: 
either a direct reflection of getClipData() if that is non-null, 
or a new ClipData built from getData().

Added in API level 22
Intent createChooser (Intent target, 
                CharSequence title, 
                IntentSender sender)
                
Convenience function for creating a ACTION_CHOOSER Intent.

Builds a new ACTION_CHOOSER Intent that wraps the given target intent, also optionally supplying a title. If the target intent has specified FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION or FLAG_GRANT_WRITE_URI_PERMISSION, then these flags will also be set in the returned chooser intent, with its ClipData set appropriately: either a direct reflection of getClipData() if that is non-null, or a new ClipData built from getData().

The caller may optionally supply an IntentSender to receive a callback when the user makes a choice. This can be useful if the calling application wants to remember the last chosen target and surface it as a more prominent or one-touch affordance elsewhere in the UI for next time.
