Helper to register for and send broadcasts of Intents to local objects within your process. 
This is has a number of advantages over sending global broadcasts with sendBroadcast(Intent):

You know that the data you are broadcasting won't leave your app, 
so don't need to worry about leaking private data.
It is not possible for other applications to send these broadcasts to your app, 
so you don't need to worry about having security holes they can exploit.
It is more efficient than sending a global broadcast through the system.
