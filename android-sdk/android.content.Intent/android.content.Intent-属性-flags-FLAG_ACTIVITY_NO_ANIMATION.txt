    /**
     * If set in an Intent passed to {@link Context#startActivity Context.startActivity()},
     * this flag will prevent the system from applying an activity transition
     * animation to go to the next activity state.  This doesn't mean an
     * animation will never run -- if another activity change happens that doesn't
     * specify this flag before the activity started here is displayed, then
     * that transition will be used.  This flag can be put to good use
     * when you are going to do a series of activity operations but the
     * animation seen by the user shouldn't be driven by the first activity
     * change but rather a later one.
