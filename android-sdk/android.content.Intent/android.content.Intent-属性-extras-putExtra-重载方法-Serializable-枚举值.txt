http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2836256/passing-enum-or-object-through-an-intent-the-best-solution

This is an old question but everybody fails to mention that 
Enums are actually Serializable and therefore 
can perfectly be added to an Intent as an extra. 

Like this:

public enum AwesomeEnum {
  Something, Other;
};

intent.putExtra("AwesomeEnum", AwesomeEnum.Something);

AwesomeEnum result = (AwesomeEnum) intent.getSerializableExtra("AwesomeEnum");

The suggestion to use static or application wide variables is a really bad idea. 
This really couples your activities to a state managing system and it is hard to maintain, 
debug and problem bound.
