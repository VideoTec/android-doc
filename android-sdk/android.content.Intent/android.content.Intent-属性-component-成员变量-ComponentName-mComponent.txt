component -- 

Specifies an explicit name of a component class to use for the intent. 
Normally this is determined by 
looking at the other information in the intent (the action, data/type, and categories) and 
matching that with a component that can handle it. 

evaluation[英][ɪˌvæljʊ'eɪʃn] [美][ɪˌvæljʊˈeʃən]
n.估价；<数>赋值；估计价值；[医学]诊断

If this attribute is set then none of the evaluation is performed, and 
this component is used exactly as is. 
By specifying this attribute, all of the other Intent attributes become optional.
