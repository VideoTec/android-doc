    /**
     * Activity Action: Display an activity chooser, allowing the user to pick
     * what they want to before proceeding.  This can be used as an alternative
     * to the standard activity picker that is displayed by the system when
     * you try to start an activity with multiple possible matches, with these
     * differences in behavior:
     * <ul>
     * <li>You can specify the title that will appear in the activity chooser.
     * <li>The user does not have the option to make one of the matching
     * activities a preferred activity, and all possible activities will
     * always be shown even if one of them is currently marked as the
     * preferred activity.
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * This action should be used when the user will naturally expect to
     * select an activity in order to proceed.  An example if when not to use
     * it is when the user clicks on a "mailto:" link.  They would naturally
     * expect to go directly to their mail app, so startActivity() should be
     * called directly: it will
     * either launch the current preferred app, or put up a dialog allowing the
     * user to pick an app to use and optionally marking that as preferred.
     * <p>
     * In contrast, if the user is selecting a menu item to send a picture
     * they are viewing to someone else, there are many different things they
     * may want to do at this point: send it through e-mail, upload it to a
     * web service, etc.  In this case the CHOOSER action should be used, to
     * always present to the user a list of the things they can do, with a
     * nice title given by the caller such as "Send this photo with:".
     * <p>
     * If you need to grant URI permissions through a chooser, you must specify
     * the permissions to be granted on the ACTION_CHOOSER Intent
     * <em>in addition</em> to the EXTRA_INTENT inside.  This means using
     * {@link #setClipData} to specify the URIs to be granted as well as
     * {@link #FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION} and/or
     * {@link #FLAG_GRANT_WRITE_URI_PERMISSION} as appropriate.
     * <p>
     * As a convenience, an Intent of this form can be created with the
     * {@link #createChooser} function.
     * <p>
     * Input: No data should be specified.  get*Extra must have
     * a {@link #EXTRA_INTENT} field containing the Intent being executed,
     * and can optionally have a {@link #EXTRA_TITLE} field containing the
     * title text to display in the chooser.

    /**
     * Activity Action: Allow the user to select a particular kind of data and
     * return it.  This is different than {@link #ACTION_PICK} in that here we
     * just say what kind of data is desired, not a URI of existing data from
     * which the user can pick.  An ACTION_GET_CONTENT could allow the user to
     * create the data as it runs (for example taking a picture or recording a
     * sound), let them browse over the web and download the desired data,
     * etc.
     * <p>
     * There are two main ways to use this action: if you want a specific kind
     * of data, such as a person contact, you set the MIME type to the kind of
     * data you want and launch it with {@link Context#startActivity(Intent)}.
     * The system will then launch the best application to select that kind
     * of data for you.
     * <p>
     * You may also be interested in any of a set of types of content the user
     * can pick.  For example, an e-mail application that wants to allow the
     * user to add an attachment to an e-mail message can use this action to
     * bring up a list of all of the types of content the user can attach.
     * <p>
     * In this case, you should wrap the GET_CONTENT intent with a chooser
     * (through {@link #createChooser}), which will give the proper interface
     * for the user to pick how to send your data and allow you to specify
     * a prompt indicating what they are doing.  You will usually specify a
     * broad MIME type (such as image/* or {@literal *}/*), resulting in a
     * broad range of content types the user can select from.
     * <p>
     * When using such a broad GET_CONTENT action, it is often desirable to
     * only pick from data that can be represented as a stream.  This is
     * accomplished by requiring the {@link #CATEGORY_OPENABLE} in the Intent.
     * <p>
     * Callers can optionally specify {@link #EXTRA_LOCAL_ONLY} to request that
     * the launched content chooser only returns results representing data that
     * is locally available on the device.  For example, if this extra is set
     * to true then an image picker should not show any pictures that are available
     * from a remote server but not already on the local device (thus requiring
     * they be downloaded when opened).
     * <p>
     * If the caller can handle multiple returned items (the user performing
     * multiple selection), then it can specify {@link #EXTRA_ALLOW_MULTIPLE}
     * to indicate this.
     * <p>
     * Input: {@link #getType} is the desired MIME type to retrieve.  Note
     * that no URI is supplied in the intent, as there are no constraints on
     * where the returned data originally comes from.  You may also include the
     * {@link #CATEGORY_OPENABLE} if you can only accept data that can be
     * opened as a stream.  You may use {@link #EXTRA_LOCAL_ONLY} to limit content
     * selection to local data.  You may use {@link #EXTRA_ALLOW_MULTIPLE} to
     * allow the user to select multiple items.
     * <p>
     * Output: The URI of the item that was picked.  This must be a content:
     * URI so that any receiver can access it.

     * {@literal *}/*.

     * multiple selection), then you can specify {@link #EXTRA_ALLOW_MULTIPLE}
