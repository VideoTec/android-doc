An easy adapter to map columns from a cursor to TextViews or ImageViews defined in an XML file. You can specify which columns you want, which views you want to display the columns, and the XML file that defines the appearance of these views. Binding occurs in two phases. First, if a SimpleCursorAdapter.ViewBinder is available, setViewValue(android.view.View, android.database.Cursor, int) is invoked. If the returned value is true, binding has occured. If the returned value is false and the view to bind is a TextView, setViewText(TextView, String) is invoked. If the returned value is false and the view to bind is an ImageView, setViewImage(ImageView, String) is invoked. If no appropriate binding can be found, an IllegalStateException is thrown. If this adapter is used with filtering, for instance in an AutoCompleteTextView, you can use the SimpleCursorAdapter.CursorToStringConverter and the FilterQueryProvider interfaces to get control over the filtering process. You can refer to convertToString(android.database.Cursor) and runQueryOnBackgroundThread(CharSequence) for more information.
