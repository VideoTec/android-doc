When the content for your layout is dynamic or not pre-determined, you can use a layout that subclasses AdapterView to populate the layout with views at runtime. A subclass of the AdapterView class uses an Adapter to bind data to its layout. The Adapter behaves as a middleman between the data source and the AdapterView layoutâ€”the Adapter retrieves the data (from a source such as an array or a database query) and converts each entry into a view that can be added into the AdapterView layout.
