public abstract View getView (int position, View convertView, ViewGroup parent)

Added in API level 1
Get a View that displays the data at the specified position in the data set. You can either create a View manually or inflate it from an XML layout file. When the View is inflated, the parent View (GridView, ListView...) will apply default layout parameters unless you use inflate(int, android.view.ViewGroup, boolean) to specify a root view and to prevent attachment to the root.

Parameters
position
The position of the item within the adapter's data set of the item whose view we want.

convertView
The old view to reuse, if possible. Note: You should check that this view is non-null and of an appropriate type before using. If it is not possible to convert this view to display the correct data, this method can create a new view. Heterogeneous lists can specify their number of view types, so that this View is always of the right type (see getViewTypeCount() and getItemViewType(int)).

parent
The parent that this view will eventually be attached to

Returns
A View corresponding to the data at the specified position.
