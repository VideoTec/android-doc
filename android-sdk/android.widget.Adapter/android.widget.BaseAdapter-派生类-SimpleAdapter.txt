An easy adapter to map static data to views defined in an XML file. 
You can specify the data backing the list as an ArrayList of Maps. 
Each entry in the ArrayList corresponds to one row in the list. 
The Maps contain the data for each row. 
You also specify an XML file that defines the views used to display the row, 
and a mapping from keys in the Map to specific views. 
Binding data to views occurs in two phases. 

First, if a SimpleAdapter.ViewBinder is available, 
setViewValue(android.view.View, Object, String) is invoked. 

If the returned value is true, binding has occurred. 
If the returned value is false, the following views are then tried in order:

A view that implements Checkable (e.g. CheckBox). The expected bind value is a boolean.
TextView. The expected bind value is a string and setViewText(TextView, String) is invoked.
ImageView. The expected bind value is a resource id or a string and setViewImage(ImageView, int) or setViewImage(ImageView, String) is invoked.
If no appropriate binding can be found, an IllegalStateException is thrown.
