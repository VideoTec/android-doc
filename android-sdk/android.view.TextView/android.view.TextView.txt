java.lang.Object
   ↳	android.view.View
 	   ↳	android.widget.TextView
	   
Displays text to the user and optionally allows them to edit it. 
A TextView is a complete text editor, 
however the basic class is configured to not allow editing; 
see EditText for a subclass that configures the text view for editing.

To allow users to copy some or all of the TextView's value and paste it somewhere else, 
set the XML attribute android:textIsSelectable to "true" or call setTextIsSelectable(true). 
The textIsSelectable flag allows users to make selection gestures in the TextView, 
which in turn triggers the system's built-in copy/paste controls.
