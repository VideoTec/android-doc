Class to notify the user of events that happen. 
This is how you tell the user that something has happened in the background.

Notifications can take different forms:

1）A persistent icon that goes in the status bar and is accessible through the launcher, 
(when the user selects it, a designated Intent can be launched),
1）Turning on or flashing LEDs on the device, or
1）Alerting the user by flashing the backlight, playing a sound, or vibrating.

系统中用 (tag, id) 标识一个 notification 
--------------------------------------------------------

Each of the notify methods takes an int id parameter and optionally a String tag parameter, which may be null. These parameters are used to form a pair (tag, id), or (null, id) if tag is unspecified. This pair identifies this notification from your app to the system, so that pair should be unique within your app. If you call one of the notify methods with a (tag, id) pair that is currently active and a new set of notification parameters, it will be updated. For example, if you pass a new status bar icon, the old icon in the status bar will be replaced with the new one. This is also the same tag and id you pass to the cancel(int) or cancel(String, int) method to clear this notification.

You do not instantiate this class directly; instead, retrieve it through getSystemService(Class).
