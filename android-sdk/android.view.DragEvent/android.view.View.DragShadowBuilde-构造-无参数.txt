public View.DragShadowBuilder ()

Added in API level 11

Construct a shadow builder object with no associated View. 
This constructor variant is only useful when the 
onProvideShadowMetrics(Point, Point) and 
onDrawShadow(Canvas) 
methods are also overridden 
in order to supply the drag shadow's dimensions and 
appearance without reference to any View object. 

不可见的 drag-shadow
If they are not overridden, 
then the result is an invisible drag shadow.
