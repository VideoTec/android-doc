public boolean onDragEvent (DragEvent event)

Added in API level 11
Handles drag events sent by the system following a call to startDrag().

When the system calls this method, it passes a DragEvent object. A call to getAction() returns one of the action type constants defined in DragEvent. The method uses these to determine what is happening in the drag and drop operation.

Parameters
event	The DragEvent sent by the system. The getAction() method returns an action type constant defined in DragEvent, indicating the type of drag event represented by this object.
Returns
true if the method was successful, otherwise false.

The method should return true in response to an action type of ACTION_DRAG_STARTED to receive drag events for the current operation.

The method should also return true in response to an action type of ACTION_DROP if it consumed the drop, or false if it didn't.
