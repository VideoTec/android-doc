public static interface
View.OnDragListener
android.view.View.OnDragListener

Class Overview

Interface definition for a callback to be invoked when a drag is being dispatched to this view. The callback will be invoked before the hosting view's own onDrag(event) method. If the listener wants to fall back to the hosting view's onDrag(event) behavior, it should return 'false' from this callback.

public abstract boolean onDrag (View v, DragEvent event)
-------------------------------------------------------------

Added in API level 11

Called when a drag event is dispatched to a view. This allows listeners to get a chance to override base View behavior.

Parameters
v	The View that received the drag event.
event	The DragEvent object for the drag event.

Returns
true if the drag event was handled successfully, or false if the drag event was not handled. Note that false will trigger the View to call its onDragEvent() handler.
