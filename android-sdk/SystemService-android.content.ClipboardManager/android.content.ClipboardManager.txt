Class Overview
Interface to the clipboard service, for placing and retrieving text in the global clipboard.

You do not instantiate this class directly; instead, retrieve it through getSystemService(Class).

The ClipboardManager API itself is very simple: it consists of methods to atomically get and set the current primary clipboard data. That data is expressed as a ClipData object, which defines the protocol for data exchange between applications.
