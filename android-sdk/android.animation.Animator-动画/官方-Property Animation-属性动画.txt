The property animation system is a robust framework 
that allows you to animate almost anything. 
You can define an animation to change any object property over time, 
regardless of whether it draws to the screen or not. 
A property animation changes a property's (a field in an object) value 
over a specified length of time. 

To animate something, 
you specify the object property that you want to animate, 
such as an object's position on the screen, 
how long you want to animate it for, 
and what values you want to animate between.
