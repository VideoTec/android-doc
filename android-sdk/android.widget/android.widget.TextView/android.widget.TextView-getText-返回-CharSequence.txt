public CharSequence getText ()

Return the text the TextView is displaying. 
If setText() was called with an argument of 
BufferType.SPANNABLE or BufferType.EDITABLE, 
you can cast the return value from this method to Spannable or Editable, respectively.

Note: 
The content of the return value should not be modified. 
If you want a modifiable one, you should make your own copy first.
