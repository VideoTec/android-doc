There is no notion of Y scroll for a ListView in Android simply because the total height of the content is unknown. Only the height of the displayed content is known.

However it is possible to get the current position/Y scroll of a visible item using the following hack:

getListView().getChildAt(0).getTop();

getChildAt 是 ViewGroup 的方法。
