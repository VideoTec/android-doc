   â†³	android.net.wifi.WifiManager.MulticastLock
   
Allows an application to receive Wifi Multicast packets. 
Normally the Wifi stack filters out packets not explicitly addressed to this device. 

Acquring a MulticastLock will cause the stack to receive packets addressed to multicast addresses.
Processing these extra packets can 
cause a noticable battery drain and should be disabled when not needed.
