AIDL (Android Interface Definition Language) is similar to other IDLs you might have worked with. 
It allows you to define the programming interface that both the client and service agree upon in order to communicate with each other using interprocess communication (IPC). 
On Android, one process cannot normally access the memory of another process. 
So to talk, they need to decompose[美][ˌdi:kəmˈpoʊz]分解 their objects into primitives[美][p'rɪmɪtɪvz]原生的 that the operating system can understand, and marshall the objects across that boundary for you. 
The code to do that marshalling[美]['mɑ:ʃəlɪŋ]封送处理 is tedious[美][ˈtidiəs]单调沉闷的 to write, so Android handles it for you with AIDL
