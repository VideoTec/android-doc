public interface HttpEntity
An entity that can be sent or received with an HTTP message. Entities can be found in some requests and in responses, where they are optional.
There are three distinct types of entities in HttpCore, depending on where their content originates:

streamed: The content is received from a stream, or generated on the fly. In particular, this category includes entities being received from a connection. Streamed entities are generally not repeatable.
self-contained: The content is in memory or obtained by means that are independent from a connection or other entity. Self-contained entities are generally repeatable.
wrapping: The content is obtained from another entity.
This distinction is important for connection management with incoming entities. For entities that are created by an application and only sent using the HTTP components framework, the difference between streamed and self-contained is of little importance. In that case, it is suggested to consider non-repeatable entities as streamed, and those that are repeatable (without a huge effort) as self-contained.
