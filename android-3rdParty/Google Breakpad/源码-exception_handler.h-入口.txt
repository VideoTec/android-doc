II. Using the client library in Android:
========================================
The usage instructions are very similar to the Linux ones that are
found at https://chromium.googlesource.com/breakpad/breakpad/+/master/docs/linux_starter_guide.md
1/ You need to include "client/linux/handler/exception_handler.h" from a C++
   source file.
2/ If you're not using ndk-build, you also need to:
   - add the following to your compiler include search paths:
       $GOOGLE_BREAKPAD_PATH/src
       $GOOGLE_BREAKPAD_PATH/src/common/android/include
   - add -llog to your linker flags
   Note that ndk-build does that for your automatically.
3/ Keep in mind that there is no /tmp directory on Android.
   If you use the library from a regular Android applications, specify a
   path under your app-specific storage directory. An alternative is to
   store them on the SDCard, but this requires a specific permission.
For a concrete example, see the sample test application under
android/sample_app. See its README for more information.
