Interface Dao<T,ID>

Type Parameters:

T - The class that the code will be operating on.

ID - 
The class of the ID column associated with the class. 
The T class does not require an ID field. 
The class needs an ID parameter however so you can use Void or Object to satisfy the compiler.

public interface Dao<T,ID>
extends CloseableIterable<T>

The definition of the Database Access Objects that handle the reading and writing a class from the database. Kudos to Robert A. for the general concept of this hierarchy.
