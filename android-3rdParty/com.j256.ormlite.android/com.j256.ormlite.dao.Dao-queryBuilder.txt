queryBuilder

QueryBuilder<T,ID> queryBuilder()

Create and return a new query builder object 
which allows you to build a custom SELECT statement. 

You call methods on the builder 
to construct your statement and then call QueryBuilder.prepare() once you are ready to build. 

This returns a PreparedQuery object 
which gets passed to query(PreparedQuery) or iterator(PreparedQuery).
