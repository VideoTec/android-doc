CommonsWare Android Components (CWAC)
The CommonsWare Android Components, or CWAC, are open source libraries to help solve various tactical problems with Android development. Most CWAC components are packaged as a tiny JAR file that you can add to your project (e.g., drop it in libs/), requiring at most other CWAC JARs as dependencies. Most are also available as AAR artifacts in a CommonsWare repository, ready for inclusion in your Gradle-based project build scripts.

The current supported CWAC components, and their GitHub repositories, are:

cwac-adapter: Provides an AdapterWrapper, a simple wrapper class that, by default, delegates all ListAdapter methods to a wrapped ListAdapter. The idea is that you can extend AdapterWrapper and only override certain ListAdapter methods, with the rest handled via the wrapped adapter.
cwac-anddown: Provides support for Markdown syntax in Android, such as a JNI wrapper around the sundown Markdown to HTML converter.
cwac-cam2: Provides drop-in replacements for ACTION_IMAGE_CAPTURE and ACTION_VIDEO_CAPTURE, to allow you to take basic pictures and videos within your own process.
cwac-colormixer: Provides a simple color mixer widget, dialog, activity, and preference.
cwac-layouts: Provides some Android container classes for specialized situations.
cwac-merge: Provides the MergeAdapter, a ListAdapter that blends multiple Views or ListAdapters into a single ListAdapter. Use this for section headings, blending multiple sources of data together, etc.
cwac-pager: Provides classes in support of ViewPager, such as the ArrayPagerAdapter implementation
cwac-presentation: Provides classes in support of the Presentation engine in Android, for driving separate content to an external display (compared to what you shown on the device's own display)
cwac-provider: Provides StreamProvider, an extended version of Google's FileProvider, for making files, resources, and assets available to other apps via a ContentProvider
cwac-richedit: Provides RichEditText, an extended version of Google's EditText, offering formatted text entry (bold, italics, etc.)
cwac-sacklist: Provides SackOfViewsAdapter, which accepts a list of View objects and presents them in a ListAdapter.
cwac-security: Provides utility classes to help app developers defend their users.
cwac-strictmodeex: Provides utility classes to help app developers find out where they are spending too much time on the main application thread.
cwac-wakeful: Provides the WakefulIntentService, a refinement of the IntentService that keeps the device awake while background tasks are being processed. This is useful for work to be scheduled via the AlarmManager.
And, in case you were wondering, CWAC is pronounced like "quack".
