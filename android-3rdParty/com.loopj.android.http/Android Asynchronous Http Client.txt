An asynchronous callback-based 
Http client for Android built on top of Apache’s HttpClient libraries. 

All requests are made outside of your app’s main UI thread, 
but any callback logic will be executed 
on the same thread as the callback 
was created using Android’s Handler message passing. 

You can also use it in Service or background thread, 
library will automatically recognize in which context is ran.
