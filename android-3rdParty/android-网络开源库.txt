Volley roughly competes with Retrofit + Picasso. On the plus side, it is one library.

Retrofit uses OkHTTP automatically if available. 
There is a Gist from Jake Wharton that connects Volley to OkHTTP.

Android Async Http: Is a powerful Http client. 
Offers some functionalities as REST helper and 
integration for JSON parsing with other libraries.

Volley: Is a REST helper/library that helps you to 
deal with async requests and image loading. 
Volley it's not an http client. 
Volley uses the SDK http clients 
(the apache or the httpclient depending on the API level) 
if you don't provide one, but a common client for volley is 
OkHttp (https://goo.gl/nl2DfN). 
You can integrate Volley with Gson easily as well.

From my point of view, 
as much responsibility you give to a single library, 
less customization you have and more unneeded code you'll add.

单一库 和 多个单一功能的库 ：
That's the reason libraries as Android Async Http or ION are losing grip nowadays and
other options like the Square solutions 
(Okio + OkHttp + Retrofit + Moshi + Picasso - Those are five libraries) 
are gaining grip. 
So here you have 5 libraries that can be 
used separately as standalone or 
tied together as 2, 3 or 4. 
That's flexibility and power.

OkHttp (needs Okio) + Volley + Gson: is a common REST solution for JSON based APIs.
OkHttp (needs Okio) + Retrofit + Moshi + Picasso. This option is pretty much equivalent to the previous one.
ION is a very good library
Android Async Http:
