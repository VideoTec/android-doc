RxJava is increasingly popular in the Android developer community. I was thinking back to the “ah ha!” moment when it’s usefulness really struck me. Even before getting to grips with RxJava’s functional aspects, it looked like a neat alternative to AsyncTask and Loader.

I’m going to explore Android’s threading abstractions and explain why RxJava can provide a more satisfying API for expressing asynchronous operations.

The default abstractions 
for expressing asynchronous operations on Android
have several limitations in complex scenarios. 

RxJava provides a full-featured alternative 
with all the additional power of functional-reactive programming and
a simple interface for handling results and errors. 
Replacing an old AsyncTask is an easy way to get started.
