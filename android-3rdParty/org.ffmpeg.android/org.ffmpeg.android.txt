This project is a Java wrapper around an ffmpeg command line binary for use in Android applications. 
It depends on the android-ffmpeg project to provide the ffmpeg binary.

For ease of developer use, we've included the FFMPEG and Sox binaries in the project, 
however, we strongly recommend you compile them yourselves using the steps below.

注1：
Sox binaries
http://sourceforge.net/projects/sox/?source=navbar
SoX - Sound eXchange
SoX is the Swiss Army Knife of sound processing utilities. 
It can convert audio files to other popular audio file types 
and also apply sound effects and filters during the conversion.

注2： 调用 ffmpeg 进程
org.ffmpeg.android.FfmpegController
    String ffmpegBin = (new File(this.fileBinDir, "ffmpeg")).getAbsolutePath();
    Runtime.getRuntime().exec("chmod 700 " + ffmpegBin);
    ProcessBuilder pb = new ProcessBuilder(cmds);
    Process process1 = pb.start();
    int exitVal = process1.waitFor();

    回调通知：
    if(sc != null) {
        sc.processComplete(exitVal);
    }

注3： 编译好的二进ffmpeg命令行
