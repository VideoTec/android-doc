android sdk tools 

If you prefer to use a different IDE or run the tools from the command line or with build scripts, 
you can instead download the stand-alone Android SDK Tools. 

These packages provide the basic SDK tools for app development, without an IDE. 

可以独立用于 app 的开发，不需要任何 IDE 的配合

Managing Projects from the Command Line
分成下面几部分：
Creating an Android Project
Updating a Project
Setting up a Library Project
  Creating the manifest file
  Updating a library project
Referencing a Library Project
  Declaring library components in the manifest file
  Building a dependent application

概述：
The android tool provides you with commands to create all three types of projects. 那三种工程？
An Android project contains all of the files and resources 
that are needed to build a project into an .apk file for installation.

第一种工程：应用工程
eventually[英][ɪˈventʃuəli] [美][ɪˈvɛntʃuəli] 总归
An Android project contains all of the files and resources 
that are needed to build a project into an .apk file for installation. 
You need to create an Android project for any application 
that you want to eventually install on a device.

第二种工程：库工程
You can also designate an Android project as a library project, 
which allows it to be shared with other projects that depend on it. 
Once an Android project is designated as a library project, it cannot be installed onto a device.

第三种工程：测试工程
Test projects extend JUnit test functionality to include Android specific functionality. 
For more information on creating a test project, see Testing from other IDEs.
