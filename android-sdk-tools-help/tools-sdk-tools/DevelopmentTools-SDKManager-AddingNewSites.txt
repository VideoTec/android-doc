Adding New Sites

The SDK Update Sites tab displays the sites that Android Studio checks for Android SDK and third-party updates. You can add other sites that host their own Android SDK add-ons, then download the SDK add-ons from those sites.

For example, a mobile carrier or device manufacturer might offer additional API libraries that are supported by their own Android-powered devices. In order to develop using their libraries, you must install their Android SDK add-on, if it's not already available as a third-party add-on.

If a carrier or device manufacturer has hosted an SDK add-on repository file on their website, follow these steps to add their site to the Android SDK Manager:

Click the SDK Update Sites tab.
Click the Add icon in the tools area and enter the name and URL of the add-on site.
Click OK.
Make sure the checkbox is checked in the Enabled column.
Click OK or Apply.
Any SDK packages available from the site appear in the SDK Platforms or SDK Tools tabs.
