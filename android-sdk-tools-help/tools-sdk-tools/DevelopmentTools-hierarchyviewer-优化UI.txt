Optimizing Your UI

Sometimes your application's layout can slow down your application. To help debug issues in your layout, the Android SDK provides the Hierarchy Viewer and lint tools.

The Hierarchy Viewer application allows you to debug and optimize your user interface. It provides a visual representation of the layout's View hierarchy (the View Hierarchy window) with performance information for each node in the layout, and a magnified view of the display (the Pixel Perfect window) to closely examine the pixels in your layout.

lint[英][lɪnt] [美][lɪnt]
n.（保护伤口的）软麻布；棉绒；棉纤维；绒布

Android lint is a static code scanning tool that helps you optimize the layouts and layout hierarchies of your applications, as well as detect other common coding problems. You can run it against your layout files or resource directories to quickly check for inefficiencies or other types of problems that could be affecting the performance of your application.
