You can keep reading the logs, just by removing the "-d" flag in your code above.

The "-d" flag instruct to logcat to show log content and exit. If you remove the flag, logcat will not terminate and keeps sending any new line added to it.

Just have in mind that this may block your application if not correctly designed.

good luck.
