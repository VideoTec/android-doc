Obfuscating a single class won't have much effect: 
it may change the class name and a few field names and methods names, 
and it may optimize some code. 
Obfuscation tends to be less effective for hiding small pieces of information. 
The more application code you obfuscate, 
the more difficult it becomes to understand.

That being said, you can specify:

-keep class !com.acme.Algorithm { *; }

It keeps all classes/fields/methods outside of com.acme.Algorithm.

This should work

-keep class !com.foo.**,!com.bar.** { *; }
