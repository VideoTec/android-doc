The Android SDK Manager separates the 
SDK tools, 
platforms, and 
other components into packages for easy access and management. 

You can also customize which sites 
the SDK Manager checks for new or updated SDK packages and add-on tools. 

For example, you can configure the SDK Manager to 
automatically check for updates and notify you 
when an installed SDK Tools package is updated. 

When you receive such a notification, y
ou can then quickly decide whether to download the changes.
