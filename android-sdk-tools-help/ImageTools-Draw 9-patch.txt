Create Resizable Bitmaps (9-Patch files)

A normal PNG file (*.png) will be loaded 
with an empty one-pixel border added around the image, 
in which you can draw the stretchable patches and content area. 

A previously saved NinePatch file (*.9.png) will be loaded as-is, 
with no drawing area added, because it already exists.

The Draw 9-patch tool is a WYSIWYG editor 
that allows you to create bitmap images 
that automatically resize to accommodate the contents of the view and the size of the screen. 
Selected parts of the image are scaled 
horizontally or vertically based indicators drawn within the image.
