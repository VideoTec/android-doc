Replace is a directory based task for replacing the occurrence 
of a given string with another string in selected file.

If you want to replace a text that crosses line boundaries, 
you must use a nested <replacetoken> element.

The output file is only written if it differs from the existing file. 
This prevents spurious rebuilds based on unchanged files which have been regenerated by this task.
