Copies a file or resource collection to a new file or directory. 
By default, files are only copied if the source file is newer than the destination file, 
or when the destination file does not exist. 
However, you can explicitly overwrite files with the overwrite attribute.

Resource Collections are used to select a group of files to copy. 
To use a resource collection, the todir attribute must be set. 
Note that some resources (for example the file resource) 
return absolute paths as names and the result of using them without using a nested mapper 
(or the flatten attribute) may not be what you expect.

Note: If you employ filters in your copy operation, 
you should limit the copy to text files. 
Binary files will be corrupted by the copy operation. 
This applies whether the filters are implicitly defined 
by the filter task or explicitly provided to the copy operation as filtersets.
