android is an important development tool that lets you:

1）Create, delete, and view Android Virtual Devices (AVDs). 
See Managing AVDs from the Command Line.

2）Create and update Android projects. 
See Managing Projects from the Command Line.

3）Update your Android SDK with new platforms, add-ons, and documentation.
See SDK Manager.

If you are using Android Studio or Eclipse, 
the android tool's features are integrated into the IDE, 
so you should not need to use this tool directly.

Note: 
The documentation of options below is not exhaustive and may be out of date.
