My application has many activities and uses native library too. 
With the default ProGuard configuration 
which Eclipse generates ProGuard removes many things - 
OnClick methods, 
static members, 
callback methods which my native library uses... 

Is it there a simple way to instruct ProGuard to NOT remove anything from my package? 
Removing things saves only about 2.5% of the application size, 
but breaks my application completely. 
Configuring, testing and maintaining it class by class in ProGuard configuration would be a pain.
