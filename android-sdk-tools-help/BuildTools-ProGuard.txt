vt.使模糊，使混乱；使糊涂

每个工程里都有一个 proguard-project.txt 文件。

但是
主工程，编译时会混淆所有的引用包的类。

D:\fvideo\Android\feinnovideo\OpenSLTest\proguard-project.txt

# To enable ProGuard in your project, edit project.properties
# to define the proguard.config property as described in that file.
#
# Add project specific ProGuard rules here.
# By default, the flags in this file are appended to flags specified
# in ${sdk.dir}/tools/proguard/proguard-android.txt
# You can edit the include path and order by changing the ProGuard
# include property in project.properties.
#
# For more details, see
#   http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/tools/proguard.html

# Add any project specific keep options here:

# If your project uses WebView with JS, uncomment the following
# and specify the fully qualified class name to the JavaScript interface
# class:
#-keepclassmembers class fqcn.of.javascript.interface.for.webview {
#   public *;

ProGuard is a free Java class file shrinker, optimizer, obfuscator, and preverifier. 
It detects and removes unused classes, fields, methods, and attributes. 
It optimizes bytecode and removes unused instructions. 
It renames the remaining classes, fields, and methods using short meaningless names. 
Finally, it preverifies the processed code for Java 6 or higher, or for Java Micro Edition.

ProGuard now has a sibling optimizer and obfuscator for Android: DexGuard. 
It focuses on code protection, 
with additional features like string encryption, class encryption, and dex splitting. 
It directly targets Dalvik bytecode and streamlines the Android build process
