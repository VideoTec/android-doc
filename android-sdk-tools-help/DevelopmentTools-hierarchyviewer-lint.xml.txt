You can specify your lint checking preferences in the lint.xml file. 

If you are creating this file manually, 
place it in the root directory of your Android project. 

If you are configuring lint preferences in Android Studio, 
the lint.xml file is automatically created and added to your Android project for you.

The lint.xml file consists of an enclosing <lint> parent tag that contains one or more children <issue> elements. Each <issue> is identified by a unique id attribute value, which is defined by lint.

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<lint>
        <!-- list of issues to configure -->
</lint>

By setting the severity attribute value in the <issue> tag, you can disable lint checking for an issue or change the severity level for an issue.

The following example shows the contents of a lint.xml file.

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<lint>
    <!-- Disable the given check in this project -->
    <issue id="IconMissingDensityFolder" severity="ignore" />

    <!-- Ignore the ObsoleteLayoutParam issue in the specified files -->
    <issue id="ObsoleteLayoutParam">
        <ignore path="res/layout/activation.xml" />
        <ignore path="res/layout-xlarge/activation.xml" />
    </issue>

    <!-- Ignore the UselessLeaf issue in the specified file -->
    <issue id="UselessLeaf">
        <ignore path="res/layout/main.xml" />
    </issue>

    <!-- Change the severity of hardcoded strings to "error" -->
    <issue id="HardcodedText" severity="error" />
</lint>
