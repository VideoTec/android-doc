In addition to testing that your Android application 
meets its functional requirements, 
it's important to ensure that your code has no structural problems. 
Poorly structured code can 
impact the reliability and efficiency of your Android apps and 
make your code harder to maintain. 

For example, 
if your XML resource files contain unused namespaces, 
this takes up space and incurs unnecessary processing. 
Other structural issues, 
such as use of deprecated elements or API calls 
that are not supported by the target API versions, 
might lead to code failing to run correctly.
