You can specify your lint checking preferences in the lint.xml file. 

If you are creating this file manually, 
place it in the root directory of your Android project. 

If you are configuring lint preferences in Android Studio, 
the lint.xml file is automatically created and 
added to your Android project for you.

The lint.xml file consists of an enclosing <lint> parent tag 
that contains one or more children <issue> elements. 
Each <issue> is identified by a unique id attribute value, 
which is defined by lint.

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <lint>
        <!-- list of issues to configure -->
    </lint>

By setting the severity attribute value in the <issue> tag, 
you can disable lint checking for an issue or change the severity level for an issue.

Tip: 
To see the full list of issues supported by the lint tool and 
their corresponding issue IDs, run the lint --list command.
