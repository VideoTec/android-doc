public void onDestroyView ()

Called when the view 
previously created by onCreateView(LayoutInflater, ViewGroup, Bundle) 
has been detached from the fragment. 

The next time the fragment needs to be displayed, a new view will be created. 

This is called 

1）after onStop() and 
2）before onDestroy(). 

It is called regardless of whether onCreateView(LayoutInflater, ViewGroup, Bundle) 
returned a non-null view. 

Internally it is called after the view's state has been saved 
but before it has been removed from its parent.
