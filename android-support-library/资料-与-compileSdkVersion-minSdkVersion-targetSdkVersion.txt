--------------------------------------
compileSdkVersion
--------------------------------------
Note that if you use the Support Library, 
compiling with the latest SDK is a requirement for using the latest Support Library releases. 

For example, 
to use the 23.1.1 Support Library, 
you must have a compileSdkVersion of at least 23 (those first numbers need to match!). 

In general, 
a new version of the Support Library is released alongside a new platform version, 
providing compatibility shims to newly added APIs as well as new features.

--------------------------------------
minSdkVersion
--------------------------------------
Keep in mind that libraries you use, 
such as any of the Support Libraries or Google Play services, 
may have their own minSdkVersion
your app’s minSdkVersion must be at least as high as your dependencies’ minSdkVersion
if you have libraries that require 4, 7, and 9, 
your minSdkVersion must be at least 9. 

In rare cases where you want to continue 
to use a library with a higher minSdkVersion than your app 
(and deal with all edge cases/ensure the library is only used on newer platform versions), 
you can use the tools:overrideLibrary marker, but make sure to test thoroughly!
