CoordinatorLayout is a super-powered FrameLayout.

CoordinatorLayout is intended for two primary use cases:

1）As a top-level application decor or chrome layout
2）As a container for a specific interaction with one or more child views

By specifying Behaviors for child views of a CoordinatorLayout you 
can provide many different interactions within a single parent and those views 
can also interact with one another. 
View classes can specify a default behavior 
when used as a child of a CoordinatorLayout using the DefaultBehavior annotation.

Behaviors may be used to implement 
a variety of interactions and 
additional layout modifications ranging from sliding drawers and 
panels to swipe-dismissable elements and 
buttons that stick to other elements as they move and animate.

Children of a CoordinatorLayout may have an anchor. 
This view id must correspond to an arbitrary descendant of the CoordinatorLayout, 
but it may not be the anchored child itself or a descendant of the anchored child. 
This can be used to place floating views relative to other arbitrary content panes.
