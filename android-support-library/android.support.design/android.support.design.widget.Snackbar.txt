Snackbars provide lightweight feedback about an operation. 
They show a brief message at 
the bottom of the screen on mobile and lower left on larger devices. 
Snackbars appear above all other elements on screen and 
only one can be displayed at a time.

They automatically disappear 
after a timeout or after user interaction elsewhere on the screen, 
particularly after interactions that summon a new surface or activity. 
Snackbars can be swiped off screen.

Snackbars can contain an action 
which is set via setAction(CharSequence, android.view.View.OnClickListener).

To be notified when a snackbar has been shown or dismissed, 
you can provide a Snackbar.Callback via setCallback(Callback).
